<p>Hi, I'm a computer science major at <a href="http://pomona.edu">Pomona College</a> in Greater Los Angeles. Right now, I'm working full time on <a href='https://clef.io'>Clef</a>. Some past things I've built are: <a href='http://gitbattle.com'>GitBattle</a>, <a href='http://likesecret.com'>Like Secret</a>, <a href='http://mentor.im'>Mentor.im</a>, and <a href='http://5crideshare.com'>5C Ride Share</a>.</p>

<p>At Pomona, I play on the <a href="http://www.pe.pomona.edu/sports/msoc/index">varsity soccer team</a>, run Hack, which has organized the 1st and 2nd Bi-Annual Hackathons on campus, and help lead Pomona Ventures--our school's entrepreneurship club. When I'm not in front of a computer, I love playing beach volleyball, telemark skiing, discussing politics, entrepreneurship, and technology, and riding my <a href="http://www.solebicycles.com/">Sole fixed gear</a>.  </p>
