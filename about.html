<p>Hi, I'm a computer science major at <a href="http://pomona.edu">Pomona College</a> in Greater Los Angeles. I am the founder and maintainer of the <a href="http://5crideshare.com">5C Ride Share App</a> and <a href="http://likesecret.com">Like Secret</a>.</p>

<p>At Pomona, I play on the <a href="http://www.pe.pomona.edu/sports/msoc/index">varsity soccer team</a>, am an active member of the <a href="http://kairossociety.org">Kairos Society</a>, and founded Hack, our computer club. When I'm not in front of a computer, I love playing beach volleyball, telemark skiing, discussing politics, entrepreneurship, and technology, and riding my <a href="http://www.solebicycles.com/">Sole fixed gear</a>.  </p>
