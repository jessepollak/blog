*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at Pomona College outside of Los Angeles. This summer, I'm a hackNY Fellow and technical intern at BuzzFeed. I'm living in Union Square, working in the Flatiron District, gradually finding my way around NYC, and hoping to learn as much as possible (about anything and everything). To assist in that learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day (I've never been able to last longer than a week, so wish me luck): today is day 7.*

Just like yesterday, I'll start today's post with last night. After writing yesterday's post, I met up with David and walked down 14th street to the Meatpacking District for dinner.

Before dinner, we popped up onto the Highline Park and wandered for a while. I have to admit, it is probably the nicest park I have ever been to. The juxtoposition between the beautiful flora and the tall buildings is amazing. Plus, with a view onto the water, it sets up some amazing sunset moments:

Also, they have awesome (talking!) water fountains:

For dinner, we went to a unreasonably dark and date-esque Thai place called Sea. I think David and I were the only two people eating there who **weren't** on a date. Regardless, it was great food and a pretty cool environment. After dinner, we just went back to the dorm and hung outâ€”nothing too interesting.

Today, I went uptown around lunch to meet up with David and Nissa Gustafson. The trip up was terrible: I still can't seem to figure out the NYC metro system. She was working at the farmers' market on 81st and Columbus, so we picked her up and grabbed lunch at a chicken place. By accident, we spilled an entire jar of ketchup onto our fries, but they were nice enough to give us some new ones. After lunch, we stumbled upon a pretty awesome street fair on Broadway:

Nissa gave us some delicious greens and we wandered across the Great Lawn (with David posing as a model):

Tonight, we tried to go bowling, but it was 21+ then headed to Shake Shack for burgers and shakes. It was underwhelming...waaayyy too much hype. 

With the Nats sweeping the Braves tonight, it was an overall great weekend.
