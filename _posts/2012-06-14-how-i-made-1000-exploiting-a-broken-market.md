*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 25. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me)*

Writers block has hit, so I'm going to add a new tradition to this blog: telling 'entrepreneurial' stories about my past. First up: how I made $1000+ dollars exploiting a broken market.

Think back to the summer of 2008. The original iPhone had been released a year earlier and the new iPhone 3G had just come out. At this point, there was a crazy dynamic in the market: the original iPhone could be unlocked, but the new iPhone 3G could not (yet), so people were willing to pay a huge amount of money for a original iPhone. If you had one in good condition, you could sell if for upwards of $500. However, since this was such an obvious profit point, there were already hundreds of people clogging Craigslist with requests to buy old iPhones for a "good deal of $200," and then reselling them for $500. Not exactly the cutthroat market a young kid like me was interested in.

At that time, I was just finishing my freshmen year in high school, loved technology, could take apart and fix an iPhone screen, and had a little smarts. Right as school ended, a fateful accident happened: I was rough housing in a friends house and slammed my pocket against a table; inadvertently cracking the screen on my iPhone (one which I'd bought a few months earlier from a friend). Devastated, I turned to Craiglist to see if I could find a new one; however, as I mentioned earlier, it wasn't exactly the perfect time to buy. Thinking all hope was lost, I asked my mom if I could have her old flip phone. Unfortunately, that too was broken. Luckily, she had another idea: I should post on our neighborhood listserv asking if anyone had an old phone I could buy. 

Thinking I'd take a chance, I decided to post asking if anyone was upgrading to the iPhone 3G and would be willing to sell their old iPhone. I didn't really think I would get one, but I figured it was worth a shot. Boy, was I wrong. Within a day, multiple people had emailed offering me their phone. And, unlike the people on Craiglist, the people in my neighborhood didn't understand that the old product they were giving away was actually worth more than the new one they were getting. Seeing an opportunity, I quickly responded to everyone saying that I would love to buy their phone and that I was extremely grateful. Yes, I understand that this was a little unethical, and I felt a little bad, but I have no regrets. So, within three weeks of breaking my most prized possession, I had bought myself a replacement—and 3 more—all for a little over $700.

As you can expect, I quickly turned these phones around for a hefty profit. My plan didn't end there though; this knowledge inequality was too good to be left alone. Next, I advertised for iPhones with broken screens. These, people were practically willing to give away for free. And, because they could be unlocked, I could sell them on Craiglist for a couple hundred dollars with a broken screen or fix the screen myself and sell them for market price.

All in all, I exploited the knowledge gap between my suburban neighborhood and capitalist Craiglist to the tune of over $1000 dollars. I'm sure many others exploited a similar situation, but I thought the story was worth sharing anyways.
