*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at Pomona College outside of Los Angeles. This summer, I'm a hackNY Fellow and technical intern at BuzzFeed. I'm living in Union Square, working in the Flatiron District, gradually finding my way around NYC, and hoping to learn as much as possible (about anything and everything). To assist in that learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day (I've never been able to last longer than a week, so wish me luck): today is day 6.*

Today, I'll deviate from my regularly scheduled programming: it's a weekend day, so I won't be following the regular structure these posts take. Instead, I'll just talk about the day, share some pictures, and be little less "techy".

In fact, I'll start with last night: a bunch of us hackNYers decided to head to a live jazz club called [Fat Cat](http://www.fatcatmusic.org/). It was an awesome place: huge, 20 pools tables, 10 ping pong tables, chess and scrabble boards at every table, and an awesome variance of different people. I played my first game of chess in years, listened to some awesome music, dabbled in ping pong, and got to know the kids I'll be living and working with over the next few months a whole lot better. Later, we headed back to the dorm and played a few rounds of [Cards Against Humanity](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/): one of the funniest, and most horrible, games I've ever played. It was a great first night in the city.

This morning, we went with our mentors to Governors Island and had a picnic. We explored, did some team building exercises (surprisingly fun), and got to know each other a little better. Here's a photo of a rickety old bridge to the fort on the island:

After, we took the ferry back to Manhattan, then headed to Brooklyn to do some exploring:

We walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and made it to the metro home right as it started pouring...pretty amazing:

Tonight, I'm heading Uptown to meet up with David Connor from Pomona and hopefully we'll have a great time...more stories tomorrow.
