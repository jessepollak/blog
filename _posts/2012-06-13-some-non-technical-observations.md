*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 24. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me)*

Today, I thought I'd break from my weekday norm and do a post on some non-technical observations. Before I start, however, here's the update on my latest technical endeavors: I've been doing a lot of stuff with `tcpdump` lately, am learning how to manage EC2 images, am returning to rails, and am continuing my endeavors with MongoDB.

Everyday, I walk to work. The walk is about 12 blocks, so it takes me around 15 minutes. And, everyday, I don my headphones and tune into Pandora. Occasionally, however, something gets in the way: I leave the apartment building at the same time as another hackNY fellow—heading in the same direction. The first time this happened, I took off my headphones and walked and talked most of the way with the fellow. The last few times, I've taken a different approach: rather than try and be polite, I just say "have a good day!," turn up the music, and walk away as fast as possible. The first time I did this, I felt really uncomfortable. Not only did it seem rude, I also felt like I was missing out on an opportunity for social interaction; something, which I think I could use a little more of considering I sit in front of a computer for 12 hours a day.

After thinking about this decision a little more, I've come to understand why I did it the first time—and why I keep doing it. Like I said, for 12 hours a day I sit in front of a computer. All that time, I'm either reading something, coding something, watching something, or talking to someone (or something!). And, when I'm not sitting in front of my computer, I am usually eating or socializing: things involving other people. Thus, it dawned on me that my walk to work is the only "me" time I have all day. Having time like this is *very* important to me: it lets me process the previous day, think about the coming day, and just relax. I've come to think of it as my mini Meeting for Worship (if you don't know what that means, see Quaker) and I refuse to give it up. 

As a random corollary to this topic, the other day I was walking down the street (headphones in) and got into the exact same stride pattern as a lady walking next to me. We walked for nearly two complete blocks side by side, stride for stride. It was odd.

Today, I realized that BuzzFeed Ben, the editor-in-chief at BuzzFeed, was Ben Smith, of former Politico blogging fame. For some reason, I'd never made the connection before, but today I sat in on a presentation he was giving and he mentioned that he used to write a political blog...then it clicked. He mentioned how back in 2008 people used to refresh blogs for content and how that seems to have stopped now. I told him that I was one of those people; he was very happy. We got to talking and I learned how well BuzzFeed really is doing in the political world. BuzzFeed is [ranked #7 on the Memeorandum leader board](http://www.memeorandum.com/lb), ahead of the WSJ, AP, Reuters and many others. Pretty crazy—everyone seems to think that we'll pull a HuffPo and explode this election. I hope we do.

Dennis Crowly and Harry Haymann (two of the founders of Foursquare) came and talked to us today. Well technically, we went to them. I'm not complaining though, the Foursquare offices are gorgeous and the food was delicious. Their talk was amazing and they really made it seem like Foursquare would be a great place to work, who knows? Some wisdom:

* Don't listen when people tell you things aren't going to work
* Nothing happens overnight (I guess I was ahead of the curve last night, eh?)
* Never going to double your own productivity—learn to hire.
* The hardest part of a startup is growing the company
