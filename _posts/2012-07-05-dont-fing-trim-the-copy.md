*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 45. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

**EDIT: Wow, this got a more intense reaction than I expected. To be clear, my partner and I worked out our differences and both learned a lot from the experience. Both of us are still young, still learning, and taking everything on day at a time.**

**If you're interested, here's [her thoughts on the story](http://grungerabbit.tumblr.com/post/26629033269/on-dont-f-ing-trim-the-copy) (and a lovely addendum on "racism, sexism, and feeling like a perpetual outsider"). She is a wonder to work with, a terrific writer, and a magnificent designer—I strongly encourage you to read her post and to check out her work.**

# "You fucking trimmed my copy."

I saw it in the message preview before I'd even opened up the email. Instantly, I knew I'd done something wrong, but it took me a few seconds to piece together what a stupid mistake it had been.

A little backstory: right now, I'm working on a project with a group of other people. At 6am this morning, on the bus from Woodstock (where I spent the 4th of July) to Manhattan (where I had work at 9am) I decided to put in some hours on our landing page.

# You can't be the best at everything

The last two days, while I'd been relaxing in the rivers and mountains of upstate NY, one of my partners had been tirelessly building the landing page. I'm not particularly good at design or copy, so I placed the entire product in their hands. Unsurprisingly, they returned an absolutely beautiful page, filled with captivating and engrossing copy. While I'm usually pretty good at deferring "product" decisions to other people, something about a long, early morning bus ride had me digging into the copy they'd literally spent hours crafting.

# Small things can undermine a relationship.

As I often do when I get engrossed in something, I started nitpicking. First the language, then the length. While I changed nothing too substantial, my mark was obvious. Unfortunately, it wasn't obvious to me to tell them that I'd adjusted their work.

# "I don't want to get mad but I sat there for FIVE HOURS crafting that yesterday, there's a reason for every word."

It took a couple hours for them to realize, but when they did their frustration was obvious (see above). And, when they mentioned it, I instantly realized what a terrible thing I'd done. By changing the copy to what *I* thought was right, then pushing it live (because I manage deploys), I completely and entirely undermined their work on the project. Unconsciously, I had asserted that *I* had the right to make the final decision; a grave mistake, and a belief I can I honestly say I don't hold.

# People are by far the most important thing 

Tonight, [Chris Dixon](http://cdixon.org/) talked to the fellows about startups. One of his largest pieces of advice was fitting: the largest reason startups fail, and one of the biggest reasons they succeed, is the ability of the cofounders to work together. It's said often, but it can be hard to remember.

While this may not be the team I spend the rest of my career with, I can honestly say that the group of individuals I'm currently working with are some of the most thoughtful, energetic, and enthused people I've ever collaborated with. That being said, my experience today just shows how easy it can be for things to turn bad. One bad snip, one mean comment, one "small" thing to you and it can start to snowball; the "unimportant" things can sometimes ruin a relationship.

# Treat others the way you want to be treated

It's a saying I learned in Quaker school, but it applies to almost every situation. I don't want to be undermined, so I shouldn't undermine anyone else—consciously or unconsciously.
