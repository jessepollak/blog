To this moment, it's been nearly 3 months since I've written anything on this blog. For that reason alone, I feel ashamed--this summer, I proved to myself that it is 100% possible to write a consistent, and occasionally interesting, blog--not continuing that through the start of the school year was a mistake. With that confession/deprecation out of the way, I'll take a longish look towards the past and a short glance towards the future.

It's been a busy fall. Wait, let me rephrase that, it's been a *full* fall (I've committed to not using the word 'busy', more to come on that later). Here are some of the things I've been up to:

**Playing on the varsity soccer team at Pomona**. This was my second year as a Sagehen soccer player. Usually confined to the bench, I played a total of 12 minutes this year in a defensive role. That embarassing fact out of the way, I'm extremely proud to say I'm part of a such a wonderful team: not only did we win the SCIAC (our league) and go 14-5-1 on the season, we did it by winning our last 12 games in a row. While I didn't play much of an *active* role in those wins, I like to think I played an extremely valuable *supportive* role from the bench (and I enjoyed every second of it). 

**[Clef](https://clef.io)**. If you don't know already, I joined Brennen, Mark, and Michael, three seniors at Pomona, as a co-founder of a young company called Clef. Here's the basic gist: we're creating a new identity platform for the web that replaces all usernames and passwords with your mobile phone. Not only does this mean you never have to remember random text again, it is also 2-factor authentication (read: more secure). It's a pretty cool thing and you should definitely check out the 'beta' at [https://clef.io](https://clef.io). We're looking for websites to integrate with, so if you might be interested (or just have any questions/feedback), definitely shoot me an email.

**5C Hackathon**. Last weekend, Pomona College hosted the 2nd Bi-Annual 5C Hackathon on Friday night. I was one of the organizers for the first one last year and ran it back this year with even greater success: we had 100+ hackers show up, had 17 teams present, and gave out some badass prizes. On my end, I built [GitBattle](http://gitbattle.com), the easiest way to battle any two Github accounts, and took home the People's Choice award with [Remy G](http://twitter.com/datarem). I'll be writing up a post mortem on that over the next few days; I learned some awesome new things about javascript.

**Art**. Yes, I've been doing art. I'm taking a Fundamentals of Digital Design class this semester and it has me doing all sorts of interesting things. A few of my favorite creations:

Despite the fact that my art may not be that great, I've been empowered by this class and have gained a new interest in *trying* to create beautiful things; leading me to design the [Clef website](https://clef.io) and work on the design of our new iPhone app that should be coming out in a couple weeks. Feedback? Thoughts?

**Syntax**. I came to college knowing that I wanted to do Computer Science, but quickly fell in love with Linguistics as well. While it may just be how awesome my professor has been (yes, all of the Linguistics classes I have taken have been with the same professor), it's been an unexpected, yet awesome, interest. This semester, I'm in the highest level Syntax class and we're doing some pretty badass stuff. If you're interested, here's a summary of some intense Chomsky that I wrote: [Jesse's Chomsky Summary](http://f.cl.ly/items/2w0c222W3D13392z2d34/9:9_summary.pdf).

All in all, it's definitely been a full first half of the semester. Luckily, with soccer over, things are starting to settle down, so I will have a lot more time to do other things, like:

**WRITE MORE**. Yep, you heard it--I'll be writing on this blog a whole lot more. While it may not be every day, I'm committing to *at least* 3 times a week. I already have some interesting topics lined up, so stay tuned.

**Code more**. I love coding, enough said. I feel like I'm finally starting to 'come into my own'--now I just need to stay there.

**Get off campus more**. On a college campus, it's so easy to never leave the bubble. Yet, every time I do, I always ask myself why I don't do it more often. I'm committing to leaving the bubble more.

**Redesign this site**. Yeah, I'll do it.

It's going to be an exciting few months, keep reading here and/or follow me on Twitter [here](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) if you're interested in my thoughts/ideas/ramblings.
