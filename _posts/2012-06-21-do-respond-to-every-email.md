*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 32. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

Recently, a lot of posts on Hacker News have focused on how to say productive as an entrepreneur. The most recent, [7 Do's and Don'ts for Founders](http://ryancarson.com/post/25580650719/7-dos-and-donts-for-founders) by [Ryan Carson](http://ryancarson.com/) is one of the better ones I've read. 

In the post, Ryan clearly articulates a variety of concrete steps that founders can take to be successful. For six of the seven bullet points, I agree wholeheartedly: organize your daily todos, constantly say, and believe in, your mission statement, and get profitable before raising funding, to name a few. There is one, however, that I cannot agree with. 

Under the bullet point *ignore your email* Ryan gives some valuable tips, but also suggests that a founder must accept that they **won't respond to every email they get**. 

As a young entrepreneur, one of the most meaningful things someone can do is respond to an email I send. In fact, it doesn't even matter what their response says. I've gotten 7 letter long emails, emails that tell me to go away, emails that invite me to lunch, emails that are horribly mean, and emails that take 30 minutes to read. And, I can honestly that every single one of them has been better than the responses I never received.

So, here's what I say:

# Respond to every email

Now, when I say every email, I mean every *real, sincere* email (not from a recruiter). In the startup community, anyone who takes the time to write you a well thought out email deserves a response—even if it's a brief no thank you. Accordingly, here's how I do my email:

1. Scan my inbox, delete any spam or recruiting emails.
2. Start at the top email
  * take 5 seconds to decide whether it requires serious thought/time and is something I want to respond to
    - **if it is, move on**
    - **if it's not, I send a quick, but nice, email saying I don't have the time right now**
3. Once I hit the bottom, start at the top again and respond to all of the important emails with more thought

All in all, I probably "waste" ~5 minutes per session responding to emails that would otherwise be deleted. While I understand that my email load is nowhere near that of Ryan's, I know what it feels like to never hear back from someone and believe that those 5 minutes are worth it. Besides, who knows who you're ignoring—taking 5 seconds to make a good impression could mean a lot sometime down the road.
