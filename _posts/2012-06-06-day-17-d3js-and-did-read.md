*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at Pomona College outside of Los Angeles. This summer, I'm a hackNY Fellow and technical intern at BuzzFeed. I'm living in Union Square, working in the Flatiron District, gradually finding my way around NYC, and hoping to learn as much as possible (about anything and everything). To assist in that learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day (I've never been able to last longer than a week, so wish me luck): today is day 17.*

To say the least, my run this morning was a beautiful start to the day. And, unlike yesterday, I didn't suffer from fatigue later in the day...maybe my body is finally being coerced into this schedule. That would be the jam. 

This is going to be a short post because it's late, I've been working all night, and I'm exhausted. So, the  **one big thing I learned today** (if you're confused what that means, [see my first post](http://jpollak92.github.com/2012/05/21/day-1-dont-be-afraid-to-ask-questions/)) is how d3.js really works. Finally, I've gained a solid grasp of how data is passed from node to node and how it can be manipulated to do what you want. With this power, today I was able to create far more than I had in the past 3 days combined. Hopefully I'll be able to share some screenshots (and maybe some interactive bits) of my work in the coming days—we'll see.

Completely unrelated, I've come to a new realization: the **new thing I want to learn and/or accomplish in the next few days (and for the rest of the summer)** is overcome my fear of spending money. I know that may sound douchey (and idiotic), but I really do have a problem. I'll feed myself poorly just to save a few dollars, miss those fun events because they cost too much, and every big purchase I make consumes my mind for hours. I'm certain it's a Pinger (my mom's side of the family) thing because my cousin (who I talked to about it last night) has the exact same problem—it's practically an addiction to being frugal. I need to relax...and spend.

After work today, the fellows and I met at AOL Ventures to hear Billy Chasen (the technical co-founder of Turntable.fm) speak. From his talk, it was clear that he was extremely smart; however, just like all the stories on him have said, he's extremely guarded with what he says. We had to bombard him for hours with prying questions in order to get anything **really** interesting. Regardless, it was awesome meeting him and listening to his thoughts on startups, etc.

As with every post, here are some **new and little learnings, tricks and tips**:

* For something to be a startup, you need to have an idea you can imagine yourself talking about for 5 years—otherwise it should just be a project
* "It's a lonely road without a cofounder"
* "Make sure you still enjoy life"
* Startup board meetings should be a place for venting and communicating, not pitching..you've already raised the money.

And a **fun thing**:
