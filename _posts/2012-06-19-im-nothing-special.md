*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 30. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

Yesterday, I had the good fortune of making the Hacker News front page with [an article about my feelings on "starting up" with a certain $1 billion idea](http://jessepollak.me/2012/06/18/a--billion-dollar-ideathat-i-know-im-not-ready-for/). I never expected that so many people to be interested in what I wrote and, to be honest, the last 24 hours have been pretty crazy. I won't bore you with stats or graphs; rather, just believe me when I say that the amount of contact I've had with people in the tech world has been **exponentially** greater than anything I've ever experienced before. Here are my thoughts on the experience.

# Almost exactly a week ago, I wrote a post entitled ["Reflections on Self Doubt"](http://jessepollak.me/2012/06/10/day-20-reflections-on-self-doubt/). 

In that post, I both questioned my ability as a programmer and wondered aloud whether I would ever reach a point where this self doubt stoped. To be honest, I actually think that lack of confidence is partially created by constantly reading sites like Hacker News: there are always so many smart people posting about so many cool things that it's easy to feel like an idiot. I guess, yesterday I got my chance to be one of the smart people.

# Today, I'm disappointed to tell you that I haven't transformed in 8 days.

I still have the same fears; still feel overmatched by my peers; and still worry that I'm not good enough. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that I'm not special. And, since I'm not special, the only logical conclusion I can draw is that all those people I read on Hacker News aren't special either.

Yes, in all certainty, the vast majority of posters who write eloquent things and make it to the top of Hacker News are much smarter and more advanced than I. However, they are not gods, and I am not a mere mortal. Rather, I'm sure that at some point they had, or still have, the same fears that I currently suffer from.

# Behind the wall of anonymity that the internet provides, it's easy to hide fear and flaws.

As my brother recently said: "write a blog post about something, post it on Hacker News, get some upvotes, and for all anyone knows you're an expert on the subject." I'll be honest, I'm far from an expert on invoice software, brick and mortar stores, business deals with big companies, or product pipeline. In fact, I can confidently say that I'm not even close to an expert in the things I do best: writing code, brainstorming ideas, and writing. What I am is a young kid, with (what I think are) big ideas, who likes to share them on the internet.

# I think almost everyone is just like me.

Yes, there will always be the exceptions: the people who are really experts in a variety of fields, can write like gods, and can create beautiful things in unreasonably small amounts of time. The vast majority of us, however, are constantly trying to maintain an image of calm intelligence; always trying to hide the fact that our hands and feet our paddling as hard as they possibly can to keep us afloat.

Here's the biggest lesson I've learned from the whole ordeal.

# Don't let fear of others get in your way.

If we keep forging onward, creating things, showing them to people, and believing that we are amazing, then who knows? Maybe we really will be amazing.
