*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 61. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

Last night, I stayed home and watched [Midnight in Paris](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1605783/), a pretty terrific Woody Allen movie. The protagonist, Owen Wilson, travels to Paris with his fiancé and finds an impossible slit in time to the 1920s. The movie focuses on his struggles to embrace the present, while longing to live in the past; the perpetual notion that the times before our own were better, more golden. By the end of the film, Wilson gradually accepts that no matter what era you live in, the past will always seem more appealing—a realization, which allows him to make hard decisions about his present lifestyle.

As I watched the movie, I started probing my own mind for whether I had the same nostalgia for the past. After a lot of thinking, I couldn't muster any of the same feelings about wanting to live in a previous era; however, I could see similar patterns in my relationship with the *near* past and future.

Over the last few years, growing up has become harder and harder mentally. As the days, weeks, months, and years rush by, it's hard to not look back and wish you could return. The early saturday mornings with my brothers; delicious waffles with powdered sugar at my grandparents; important soccer games in front of friends in high school; and hundreds of beautiful moments that will never—and could never— happen again. With these, I feel the nostalgia that the protagonist feels in Midnight in Paris; a wish to go back to a simpler, earlier, time.

On the other hand, the future is also the thing I'm constantly excited for. Last summer, I couldn't wait until college. Last spring, I couldn't wait to work in the city. Now, I can't wait to return to Pomona. While the present is always amazing, it feels as though the future constantly offers more—just like the past.

How can you reconcile the impossible urge to return to the past with the unbearable excitement for the future? And, where does the present fit into the picture?

As the last week of hackNY rounds up, I'll definitely be thinking a lot about this juxtaposition.
