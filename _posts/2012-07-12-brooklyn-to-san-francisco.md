*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 51. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

I missed day 50! Well, can't say I regret it too much. The last 2 days have been a blur, but here's a brief summary.

Tuesday night, I went over to Prospect Park with a bunch of friends from Pomona to see the Dirty Projectors play live. Leading up to the concert, I was very very skeptical of their music. I'd listened a few times, but always thought that it was too mellow; too whiny; just not that good. Their live performance, however, proved me wrong. To say the least, it was one of the best concerts I've been to in a long time.

The lead guy, I don't know his name, was an amazing vocalist; and, from what I've been told, he is also the brains behind the whole band. It's crazy to see someone like that who's at the "peak" of the game—outside of the startup sphere. Constantly reading sites like HN, it's easy to only see tech people who have that same kind of powerful glow about them, so it was cool to see that elsewhere.

Today, I woke up early, packed my bags, and got to work by 9:30am. By 5, I was in JFK Airport waiting for my plane. Now, I'm sitting in the W hotel in SV working on the pitch for tomorrow. It's crazy how easy it is to cross the country nowadays.

I'm really looking forward to tomorrow, but I'm also pretty fucking nervous. This is my first real exposure to investors etc and I want to make a good impression—we'll see how we do!
