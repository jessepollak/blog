*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 41. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

Today, I spent time with [Miles Grimshaw](http://milesgrimshaw.com/) working on [Hack University](http://hackuniversity.com/). The basic premise of the organization is to create a distributed curriculum that involves online material, and offline "mentor hours" with qualified mentors, on college campuses across the country. This fall, HU will be running it's first course: Introduction to Web Design w/ HTML, CSS and Javascript. Look for it on your campus.

At this point, we are in stage of creating the actual curriculum. This means crafting 6 weeks of online videos and class sections. In total, it's hundreds of short screen casts, slideshows, and videos—quite a substantial amount of work.

Being somewhat knowledgeable about web development (not design :) ), I've been helping to create a lot of this content—a task, which is way harder than I expected. Not only does it take a huge amount of time to create course material, it also takes serious thought as to what students can and cannot learn in certain periods of time. To me, the concept of variables or CSS selectors is second nature, but building that knowledge from the ground up is a very very daunting task. 

Hopefully my knowledge will allow me to help build an (at least somewhat) good course.

It's a saturday night, and I'm exhausted, but I thought I'd share that thought with the world.
