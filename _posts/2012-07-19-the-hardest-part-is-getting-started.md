*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 57. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

Over the last few days, I've been trying to set up some code on my computer. I'm coming into a project late, the people I'm working with are just transitioning to a new server setup, and no one really knows the perfect steps to easily set everything up from a fresh start. Inevitably, this means hours spent trying to figure out what's going wrong.

For instance, just in the last few hours, all of these things have happened:

- the server has suggested that there are no active routes
- the server has deemed every request "invalid syntax" and spat gibberish to the logs
- the server has not been at the correct hostname

Tackling each of these issues took a variety of tweaks, tens of gchats, and a lot of annoyance. It also reminded me, however, how f\*\*\*ing hard getting things set up can be.

With "learning to code" being the latest trend in the technology world, there's lots of discussions about how some people can learn, while others just never quite "get it." In response to discussions like these, people like Code Academy are trying to create an easy environment to get started—hoping to lower the barrier of entry, so the people who "don't get it" at first aren't always driven away. 

To be honest, I don't know if this is a good idea. At least in my experience, some of the hardest parts of being a programmer are getting through the early stages of a project. It might involve getting your development environment set up, parsing other people's code, or understanding a new framework—in each situation, you're dropped into an environment with little context and you need to teach yourself enough to get by. These moments are unbelievably frustrating—testing willpower and sanity—but through them you inevitably learn *how to teach yourself things*. With programming, and probably a lot of other skills, that's one of the most important things you can learn. For, once you can teach yourself, the possibilities are endless. 

If we isolate people from this experience at the start, I think they are far less likely to be successful in the future.

Thoughts?

**EDIT, some suitable metaphors raised in the comments:**

*"And, if you let it be easy, then you'll never actually learn much, just like if you were trying to get in shape but never actually did anything hard or frustrating"*
