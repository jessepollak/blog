*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at Pomona College outside of Los Angeles. This summer, I'm a hackNY Fellow and technical intern at BuzzFeed. I'm living in Union Square, working in the Flatiron District, gradually finding my way around NYC, and hoping to learn as much as possible (about anything and everything). To assist in that learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day (I've never been able to last longer than a week, so wish me luck): today is day 16.*

When I woke up this morning, for the first time I genuinely thought that my body was getting conditioned to my new schedule (long days, short nights). When I was falling asleep on the metro on my way uptown at 8pm, I reconsidered what my body was telling me. I've said it once today, but I'll say it again: my life would be infinitely better if I had an additional 6 hours in every day. Can someone invent a longer day already?

My time at work today was frustrating. Around midday, I scrapped the second version of my visualization and started from scratch—leaving me frustrated and confused. Luckily, this frustration was interrupted, and relieved, by an awesome lunch with [Amy Quispe](https://twitter.com/#!/amyquispe) and [Cheryl Wu](http://grungerabbit.com/) from hackNY. We met, sat down in a diner near my office, and talked tech, ideas, virality, and 'brogrammers' over lunch. By the end of the conversation, my passion was renewed, I'd successfully defended myself from the false accusation of being a 'brogrammer,' and I had something serious to invest my "free" time in over the next few days. I say "free" with quotes because I really don't have any free time: we'll have to see what I sacrifice to make room for a new thing.

The **one big thing I learned today** (if you're confused what that means, [see my first post](http://jpollak92.github.com/2012/05/21/day-1-dont-be-afraid-to-ask-questions/)) is that I need to always have an active side project going. Over the last few days, I've become increasingly concerned that I was losing interest in working on stuff outside of work. I questioned where I would find the time, whether it was "really worth it" and why I dedicated nearly all of my time to computers. After talking today, and picking something concrete to work on, I remembered what I'd gradually forgotten: it's passion that inspires me to keep working. And, in order for me to be passionate, I need to have something to pour everything I have into. Now that I have something, I feel that 'feeling' again...and it's great. After work today, I was walking somewhere and got lost in my thoughts; 5 minutes later I looked up and had no idea where I was. Ideas are intoxicating.

Also stemming from my lunch conversation, the **new thing I want to learn and/or accomplish in the next few days (and for the rest of the summer)** is learn to look at the bigger picture. I don't know if she'll appreciate this or not, but [Cheryl Wu](http://grungerabbit.com/) is one of the smartest people I've met so far this summer. Listening to her casually examine something from a grand view: product, virality, marketing, design, anything, was amazing. I hope that working with her over the summer, and other similarly smart people in this amazing city, will allow me to gain a better ability to see different parts of a project (and product) interact. I need to raise my sights above *just tech* and learn how everything interweaves.

After work, I ran (literally) to the NY Tech Meetup where "absurdity abounded." Before anything began, the other fellows and I were announced to the entire crowd (800+ people), told that we were a 'huge asset' to NYC, and forced to stand up. It was half awesome, half ridiculous. At the meetup, I saw some pretty cool startups: [Rap Genius](http://rapgenius.com/) and [Rent Hackr](http://renthackr.com/) to name two. I missed them, but I hear [NimbleTV](http://www.nimbletv.com/) is pretty awesome too.

As with every post, here are some **new and little learnings, tricks and tips**:

* Always use variables for sizes and displacements of DOM objects (and other things)—it'll save you a lot of time later.
* If you present at NYTM, don't have your tech fail on stage...that sucks.
* Don't get on the express train going the wrong way...for 40 blocks till the next stop. Terrible feeling.
* Don't ever buy shitty PaperMate pens, they are terrible and will waste more time than you save money.

And some **fun things**:

* Bryce Harper is a living legend...walk off hit today in the bottom of the 12th with 2 outs.

Enough said.
