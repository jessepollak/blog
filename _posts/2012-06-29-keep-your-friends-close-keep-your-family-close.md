*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 40. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

The other morning, I woke up to the following email from a friend:

> This is an email you don't have to respond to.
>
> I love you, you are an inspiration, I love your blog, keep doing.

I didn't put this up here to brag. I don't think I'm an inspiration; I think I'm a pretty average kid. The whole liking the blog thing is subjective; some may like it others may not. I put this up here to demonstrate how unbelievably lucky I am to have some of the best friends and family a young man could ask for.

In the last 6 weeks, I've moved to a city, left my family behind, left my friends behind, encountered all sorts of problems, and dealt with an unbelievable amount of change. The one thing that has been constant is the people I'm not actually with. Throughout it all, my friends and family have been supportive, helpful, and thoughtful: always providing the inspirational words and love at the right time.

It's a friday night and my brother is in town, so I'll leave this with a simple thought:

# If you're lucky enough to have friends and family supporting you, embrace them; love them; thank them. If you're not; find them; make them. We weren't meant to struggle alone; we need people who can support us through anything and everything.
