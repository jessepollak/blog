*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at Pomona College outside of Los Angeles. This summer, I'm a hackNY Fellow and technical intern at BuzzFeed. I'm living in Union Square, working in the Flatiron District, gradually finding my way around NYC, and hoping to learn as much as possible (about anything and everything). To assist in that learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day (I've never been able to last longer than a week, so wish me luck): today is day 14.*

Two weeks have past crazy fast: I've settled into my first job ever, completed my first project, made new friends, been to new places, seen new sights, and loved every moment of it. I'm hoping that the next 8 weeks will be even better.

I'll start this post off with the adventures of yesterday (per usual). Around noon I hopped on the R train and zipped to 54th and 8th ave where I met up with Brennan and Kim, two CS majors from Pomona, to celebrate Kim's birthday. We started off by eating soup and Chinese food at Mee's Noodle Shop (7/10) than relaxed in Kim's absurd apartment on the 38th floor of a luxury apartment building (Google internships FTW). Some of her friends from home met up with us and we went to dinner at Goodburger (9/10). After dinner, we stopped to get cupcakes:

Walked to Times Square:

And saw a pretty funny tech fail on one of the huge advertisements:

Later, since Brennan and I were the only guys, we were coerced into heading to "the club"--Webster Hall, right near Union Square. On the way, I found a cute cat on the sidewalk (I miss my cats):

Surprisingly, Webster Hall was really fun. There were a few floors and we split time between them. One of them was an awesome laser, dubstep show:

After the club, I was almost convinced to meet David uptown, but I ended up meeting with another friend from college. On the whole, a terrific night.

Today, I got to a late start (1pm, ugh), but made a split second decision to subway to Brooklyn and go rock climbing for the afternoon. I've gotta say, before I went, I definitely underestimated how hard rock climbing actually is. By the end of the session, my arms were exhausted and I'd cut holes in my fingers. Plus, I barely got past the second easiest level of climbing--I was thoroughly unimpressed with myself. Check out the awesome gym:

After rock climbing, I grabbed dinner with a friend at S'MAC (7/10), a macaroni and cheese place, and met up with another Pomona kid. On the whole, it was an exciting, and adventure filled, weekend--I can't wait for the next one.

So, time for some reflections on the first two weeks. Some of my favorite things have been:

* Learning node.js and javascript (and a ton of other new things)
* Finishing my first ever project for work
* Spending time with my extended family in uptown (and Brooklyn)
* Going to places I wouldn't usually go
* Being surrounded by people like me--it's going to be weird going back to a place where I'm not surrounded by tech nerds
* Listening to the stories of some of the brightest founders in NYC
* Rock climbing
* Carrying a journal with me at all times (I now feel empty without it)
* Walking a lot (and thinking a lot)
* Getting 3 unprompted, random high fives from strangers last night

And some of my least favorite things:

* The smells of the city
* Getting hopelessly lost on the subway
* The prices (holy shit NYC is expensive)

On the whole, it's been amazing. Keep following my adventures!
