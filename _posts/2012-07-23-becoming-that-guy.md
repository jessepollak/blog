*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 62. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

Over the last 2 years, I've sent a lot of emails to a lot of different people. Being a beginner in so many ways, I've constantly been seeking help in any form I can get. Sometimes, I get a response, sometimes I don't. 

When I don't, it's easy to superficially accept that people are busy and that you can't be to hurt by a lack of response. Ultimately, however, I always feel some sort of resentment towards the people who never respond. In fact, just earlier this summer, I vowed to [never do that](http://jessepollak.me/2012/06/21/do-respond-to-every-email/).

Over the last few weeks, my days and weeks have gradually become more and more crowded. My work hours have extended, I'm working on more projects in my free time, I want to talk to more people at night, and I'm constantly trying to do more; and more; and more. On top of that, I'm also fighting to maintain some level of life outside of technology: see my friends, do things in the city, get away from the computer. 

And, I hate to say it, but I'm starting to become the person I've always resented. Emails sit in my inbox; Facebook messages don't get responded to; I push meetings back further and further.

Is this slide inevitable? I always vowed it wouldn't happen to me; that I'd always have the energy to respond to every request, but now I'm starting to think I won't be able to do it. 

When life becomes too crowded; is unnecessary, but kind, communication the thing that gets sacrificed? Is that OK?
