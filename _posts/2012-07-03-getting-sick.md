*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 43. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

Yesterday, I started getting sick. Today, the sickness has won the battle. Runny nose, sore throat, headaches, nausea, the whole shebang. 

A few thoughts on getting sick:

It ruins productivity. Today, I was unproductive at best, useless at worst.

For me, one of the craziest things about getting sick is realizing how unappreciative I am when I'm in health. It happens every time. When I get sick, I always think the same thing: if only I could just be back to "normal," it would be the greatest thing. Then, when I get back to normal (luckily it's been everytime so far), it's just too easy to take it for granted.

I've always wondered if sickness will eventually become a thing of the past. Today, I asked a friend and he said he thought it would happen by 2040. That would be crazy, although I bet it would be a conditional lack of sickness: health for the privileged, wealthy, population of developed countries.

A question: is it healthy to exercise when you're sick? I'm keeping in my routine of running and lifting every day, but I wonder whether that makes it harder for my body to recover.

Perhaps this sickness is a sign that I need to take a break? The last week and a half have been the busiest I've ever been: between [Mentor.im](http://mentor.im), BuzzFeed, HackUniversity, and my brother visiting, I feel like every waking minute has been jam packed.

Luckily, I'm taking a break (most likely). Tomorrow, I think I'm heading to Woodstock, NY to visit friends for the 4th of July. This will (most likely) mean that I won't blog tomorrow night (and maybe even the following night!). I know that it's breaking the "streak," but at this point, I'm confident enough in my commitment to writing that I have no doubt that after missing a day or two, I'll be able to jump right back in.

While I'm (temporarily) gone, you can follow my [twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or Instragram (jpollak92) for thoughts, pictures, and more.
