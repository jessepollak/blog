Over the last few months, I've been trying to wear my "designer hat" more and more: I'm taking an art class in college, leading design responsibilities for [Clef](https://clef.io), and reimagining the way I portray myself on the web (this blog, for instance). Over break, I had the good fortune to read [Envisioning Information](http://refer.ly/agHm) by [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) and was impressed by the information design tactics that Tufte proposes. Being a reasonably dense 100+ page book, I figured that Tufte's ideas were worth summarizing for the greater world who wasn't assigned the book for a class.

Tufte's primary goal of the book is to outline a variety of design strategies that "escape flatland" and "sharpen the information resolution, the resolving power, of paper and video." As Tufte describes it, the world of information that we interact with is almost entirely caught up in the two-dimensionality of paper and video screen--endless flatlands that limit the ability to envision the information in our world that is inevitably, and happily, multivariate in nature.

Before we dive into the patterns that promote good information design, let's examine a pattern that doesn't: *Chartjunk*. As Tufte explains it, Chartjunk, includes all data presentations that "attract and divert attention by means of display apparatus and ornaments'--the "ducks of modern architecture." The example below, for instance, Tufte classifies as "data-thin," "chockablock with cliche and stereotype," and "a crucial confusion because the graph chronicales a time of high inflation':

Tufte suggests that data representation like these, where decoration takes precendence over the actual data, diminishes credibility and displays "contempt for our audience." In response, he examines some techniques that allow designers to escape "flatland," but still do the data justic:

# Micro/macro readings

Tufte calls this a "most unconventional strategy:" *to clarify, add detail*. In his words, "the fine texture of exquisite detail leads to personal micro-readings, individual stories about the data," which cumulate into "larger coherent structures"--providing a macro reading to complement the many micro readings.

One example Tufte cites is the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC (pictured below). From afar, the collection of 58,000 deceased soldiers" names on a black wall is a gray blur, which "yields a visual measure of what 58,000 means." As a reader walks forward though, the name of each individual soldier comes into focus, organized in chronological order of death and rising higher and higher, over the heads of observers, providing a micro, personal, experience where suddenly each name becomes an individual.

# Layering and seperation

Tufte describes how in flatland, various elements *interact* to create "non-informative patterns and texture simply through their combined presence"--or *1 + 1 = 3* in the words of [Josef Albers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Albers). Tufte believes that effective layering and seperation of information is "among the most powerful devices for reducing noise and enriching the content of displays.'

As an example of poor layering, Tufte presents the following:

"An information prison," Tufte describes how it employs a narrow range of strong shapes, which are "too loud and too similar." The redesign he presents next directs attention to the information at hand by extending the light to dark range of color and seperating and layering the data in rough proportion to their relevance (red movements, orange signals):

# Small multiples

According to Tufte, at the heart of quantitative reasoning is a single question: *compared to what?* With this question in mind, Tufte proposes that small, multiple designs can visually enforce a comparison of changes and the differences among objects. In the following example, the data representation captures the drawing of a single Kana character by presenting a set of small multiples:

The images are indexed by time (->) and by dual camera angle and have "a magical quality," which reflects a remark of the photographer [Garry Winogrand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Winogrand): "there is nothing as mysterious as a fact clearly described.'

# Color and information

Tying color to information is as "elementary and straightforward" as color technique in art--in other words, not that easy. Therefore, Tufte's first principle in bringing color to information is *above all, do no harm*. While a bit dated, Tufte's use of conventional computer GUIs as an example was particularly interesting to me. In a colorless environment, closely spaced dark grid lines generate *1 + 1 = 3*:

Therefore, Tufte believes that color can improve the information resolution on a computer screen. For framing fields, Tufte believes that appropriate color should be light in value (muting the *1 + 1 = 3* effect), but relatively intense and saturated: yellow is the only color that satisfies this joint requirement.

Obviously, computers didn't turn out this way (designers opted for drop shadows to distinguish frames instead), but Tufte's analysis is still interesting.

Chock full of examples, [Envisioning Information](http://refer.ly/agHm) does most of it's teaching through showing, so it's a little hard to convey every lesson in a brief summary, but I figured it was worth a shot.
