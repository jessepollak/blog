*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 18. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me)*

This is by far the latest I've ever written (in fact, I technically broke my streak—but it doesn't count). Luckily, I'm not up for no reason—this evening I somehow managed to make it home and **surprise** my mom and friends. To say the least, she loved it (and I'm sure she'll be reading this). Since it is so late, this is not going to be a very long post.

The first half of work today, I worked on re-touching up the stats dashboard I worked on last week and finishing the visualization I worked on this week. They've both turned out really well and I'm really pleased with how much I've learned. The second half of the day was a little different: primarily, I fixed my first bug and committed my commit on production code that went to users. It's not very front facing, but I transitioned part of the backend to interface with a "slave" database rather than the "master".

The  **one big thing I learned today** (if you're confused what that means, [see my first post](http://jpollak92.github.com/2012/05/21/day-1-dont-be-afraid-to-ask-questions/)) is that I'd unknowingly been excluded from a lot of the developers activities the last 3 weeks. I'd always wondered why they'd suddenly dissapear, then come back with lunch without me and today I found out how they did it. There is, in fact, a *second* dev team skype channel that is non-technical. I'd only been on the technical one, but no one realized, so they just assumed I didn't like them...maybe I'll have more friends now. In other news, they've discovered my dislike of generic meat and won't stop asking me if I'll this meat or that meat.

The **new thing I want to learn and/or accomplish in the next few days (and for the rest of the summer)** is not really new: I want to quickly recall all I've ever known about Rails. I'm writing a little app using it and I feel rusty. Hopefully it'll come back quickly.

And, here are some pictures to round out the post.

First, a nice piece of art in the AOL Ventures office:

And, a ridiculous sign I saw at Union Station:

That's almost slower than a human walks...
