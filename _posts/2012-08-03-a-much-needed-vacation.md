My summer of tech is over. Tomorrow, I'm heading to California to do a week of backpacking and then a week at the beach, so no more blog posts for a little while.

When I return, I plan on writing some reflections on the summer and some lessons learned.

This school year, I plan on actively blogging (although maybe not quite as much as this summer), so stick around.

Thanks for reading and interacting with me this summer!
