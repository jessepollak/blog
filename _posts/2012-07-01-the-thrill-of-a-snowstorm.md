*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 42. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

Growing up on the east coast, I always had a love for snowstorms. It meant snowball fights, hot chocolate, money from snow shoveling, and—most importantly—missing school. Unlike most kids, however, I started loving snowstorms for a different reason: the thrill of tracking them.

It's a little known fact about me, but I'm thoroughly obsessed with tracking east coast snowstorms. I picked up the habit from my dad, but far outstripped his interest as I grew older (although he may have overtaken me now that I live in sunny california all year round). At this point, you may be wondering "what does he even mean when he says tracking snowstorms?"

Well, it started out simply enough. When I was young, I loved watching the local forecast on the 8s on the weather channel. During the President's Day Blizzard of 2003, I clearly remember sitting in my living room; my eyes constantly flitting between the TV and the open windows: waiting for the first snowflake and praying the forecasters hadn't gotten everything wrong.

In a couple years, I would move on to the NWS, or the National Weather Service. For anyone interested, the Weather Channel provides shit forecasts—easily outdone by the NWS. Not only were the forecasts more accurate, they were also a lot more in depth. Not only was there the [point forecast page](http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Washington&state=DC&site=LWX&lat=38.895&lon=-77.0373), there were also the [alerts](http://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=DCZ001&warncounty=DCC001&firewxzone=DCZ001&local_place1=Washington+DC&product1=Hazardous+Weather+Outlook), and most importantly the [forecast discussion](http://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS&issuedby=LWX&product=AFD&format=CI&version=1&glossary=1&highlight=off). In this plain text document that was updated every few hours, you could (and can) read the actual discussions that the meteorologists had about the weather. For snowstorms, this meant being able to understand *why* they forecasted something and, more importantly, what the actual conditions were that caused that weather event. Gradually, I started learning why certain weather phenomenons happened: what a Noreaster was, the difference was between freezing rain, sleet, and hail, and how high pressure and low pressure interacted in the lower atmosphere to create weather.

As I entered high school, I took what had by then become a real hobby (meteorology) to the next level. Gradually, I moved away from reading forecasts and into actual forecasting—with other professionals and hobbyists who loved tracking snowstorms. For the next few years, whenever a snow storm approached, I would spend hours and hours on the [American Weather Forum](http://www.americanwx.com/bb/index.php/forum/12-mid-atlantic/). When I say approached, however, I don't mean coming in the next day or two. On the forums, we'd track storms for 7+ days out. There, we actually examined the models that were used to make the predictions: the EURO/ECMWF, GFS, and NAM to name a few. These were the same models the "professionals" used to make their predictions, and I would say that the people on this forum (not me though) were just as good—if not significantly better—than the professionals.

Tracking these storms was really a thrill. I'd stay up to 2am on a weeknight just to see the latest "run" of the EURO, wake up 30 minutes early for school, so I could check in on the latest information, and waste countless hours tracking storms that would never actually exist.

I think that's what kept me so excited. There was always a storm on the horizon—7 days out, 10 days out. If not, all of us were convinced that the "pattern" would "change" soon—bringing cold weather and more moisture. That feeling of *hope* was addicting.

In many ways, I see a lot of similarities between my obsession with weather and my obsession with startups. In both, the odds that The Big One® is going to happen are close to nil. Huge snow storms happen every few decades; big startups happen only once in a thousand or more. But, in both, there's always hope; hope that this one will be *the one*; hope that I'll wake up one morning and the perfect storm will have really come true.
