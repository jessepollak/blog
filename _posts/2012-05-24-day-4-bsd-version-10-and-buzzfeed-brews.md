*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at Pomona College outside of Los Angeles. This summer, I'm a hackNY Fellow and technical intern at BuzzFeed. I'm living in Union Square, working in the Flatiron District, gradually finding my way around NYC, and hoping to learn as much as possible (about anything and everything). To assist in that learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day (I've never been able to last longer than a week, so wish me luck): today is day 4.*

Another rainy day! It seems like I brought the worst weather ever to the city—it's been rainy or foggy for 4 straight days. From the start of the day, I was excited because I thought I would be able to get out the first version of the real time internal analytics dashboard I've been building at BuzzFeed. And, as I expected, I managed to get out V1.0 around 12pm—always a great feeling. Unfortunately, as with almost every "launch," there were problems: some of the key features were broken when I pushed it to the production server. Feeling like an idiot since I already sent out the link to the entire dev team, I quickly pulled it, fixed the bugs, and re-pushed it; then everything worked. The team gave me a lot of feedback and some cool feature requests that I'll be working on over the next few days. 

My **one big thing learned** (if you're confused what that means, [see my first post](http://jpollak92.github.com/2012/05/21/day-1-dont-be-afraid-to-ask-questions/)) was actually something pretty personal today. I gained a better understanding of when and why I procrastinate: **if I haven't started something, I'm way more likely to procrastinate; almost certainly because I'm afraid that the task will be unmanageable. Once I dig in, and can see a reasonable path to success, I'm good to go**. I've been starting to realize this over the last couple of weeks, but today it really set in. I had a reasonably big queue of tasks I needed to get done and, every time I finished one task and hadn't dug into another, I was likely to be nervous and confused and would be prone to putting off real work and procrastinating. If I can just *start* tasks, I can get in that zone I love.

Here are my **new and little learnings, tricks and tips** (if you haven't picked up on the trend, see my first post again):

* `ctrl-R` allows you to search recent commands in Terminal
* `history` displays recent commands in terminal, which you can jump to with `!<command#>`
* `netstat` displays all of the active network connections to and from your computer
* to tar and zip a folder, use `tar -cvzf <output.tgz> <folder>`
* to send a file via ssh use `scp <file> use@host:location`
* I have to be **very very very** careful with synchronous requests and synchronous loading of images: I got stuck on a bug with that for an hour today.

Second to last, the  **new thing I want to learn and/or accomplish in the next few days** is to overcome my fear of starting and help myself procrastinate less.

And finally, **some fun things**:

* I met and talked with Jonah Peretti (the co-founder of HuffPo and founder of BuzzFeed)
* Every other Thursday, BuzzFeed has 'Brews' where the office brings in food and drinks for everyone and all of the new people introduce themselves
* Since it was Brews today, I introduced myself and told the story of how I slept walked and tried to pee in my mom's closet over last Thanksgiving
* The sour cream in the Chipotle I went to today was odd (maybe old...)
