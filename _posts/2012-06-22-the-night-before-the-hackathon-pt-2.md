*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 33. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

It's Friday, and tomorrow is Angelhack, so today is going to be a brief post. I'll just go through my thoughts on the impending hackathon, what some of the crappy ideas we had are, what I think I'm working on, and who I'm working with.

So, in case you don't know what [Angelhack](http://angelhack.com/) is, it's probably the biggest hackathon ever. This year, it's happening in 4 different cities concurrently, with over 1000 people participting. The top two teams win $25,000 in venture funding and a paid trip to San Francisco. 

For the hackathon, I'm working with a random collection of people. [Brennen Byrne](https://twitter.com/#!/brennenbyrne) is a friend from college. [Cheryl Wu](http://twitter.com/grungerabbit) is a hackNY fellow. [Jordan Goldstein](http://twitter.com/thetabyte) is a highschooler who I met through HN. And, [Conway Anderson](http://twitter.com/conwayanderson) is a another person I met through HN. Combined, we're 2 designers, 3 developers, and think we have a chance at winning the whole thing (albeit small).

Here are some of the ideas we've had:

* an interactive sex education game (revolutionize the sex-ed industry)
* an app to tell you when your significant other makes it home safely
* a site to revolutionize the porn industry
* a site to manage offline games
* a time machine for hacker news
* a title generator for hacker news

And, the idea we are working on (although it's in flux):

Basically, we want to provide an online mentoring program for low income kids. High schoolers entering the college process often don't have the resources around them to understand what's best, so we want to provide those resources. Through our app, high schoolers will have the chance to ask questions of a strong network of mentors. These mentors will respond with video answers and then, if the kid thought the mentor was helpful, will be paired up with a mentee. Hopefully, we can make this something valuable to put on a resumé, so people will want to do it for free—perhaps by providing social reward for the amount of time you mentor (like a Facebook status). The idea is still very much in flux, and it's very hard to explain via text, but I think it has a shot to be great.

I'm actually a little nervous for this hackathon. It's 36 hours and I'm already so worn down from work, I think there's a chance I just will stop functioning midway through. Hopefully not though!

I'll try to tweet as much as possible (and maybe write some) tomorrow! Follow along on [twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak).
