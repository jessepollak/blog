*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 39. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

As work was ending today, I suddenly had an idea. 

The other day, I was talking to [Ben Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Smith_(journalist)), the editor in chief at BuzzFeed, and he told me how well BuzzFeed was doing in terms of politics. To demonstrate, he showed me the [Memeoradum Leaderboard](http://www.memeorandum.com/lb). Basically, Memeorandum is an aggregator for political stories (like its sister site TechMeme) and the leader board shows the top sites that contribute to the aggregation—ranked by percentage of total articles coming from that site. As you can see, BuzzFeed is doing suprisingly well: #6, ahead of The Huffington Post, the Wall Street Journal, and a ton of other big news sites. As he showed it to me, he said that he'd been able to watch BuzzFeed climb the list over the last few months.

Today, I started thinking about what he said and decided it would be cool if you actually *could see* that rise. So, after work ended, I stayed at the office and spent 20 minutes writing a little script that runs once a day, scrapes the site, and stores the ranking in a DB. Tomorrow night, I'll make a little d3.js chart so we can see the different news sources over time. Hopefully, by the time I end at BuzzFeed, I'll have enough data for a cool chart—preferably showing that BuzzFeed really is growing its political news influence.

After I wrote the script, I realized how lucky I was:

I had a problem.  

I thought up a solution.  

I implemented the solution in 20 minutes.  


In what other industry, with what other skills, can you do something like that? 

Being able to code really is a privilege. Luckily, it's a privilege that most anyone can attain. [Do it](http://www.codecademy.com/). [Or do it](http://www.udacity.com/). Do anything.
