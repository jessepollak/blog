*Before I get started, I just want to make clear that I strongly support the developers behind iPhone apps (especially the ones I'm talking about): building a beautiful app is never an easy task and these companies (and independent developers) have crafted pieces of (very useful) art.*

With the launch of [Any.DO](http://www.any.do/) for iPhone on Tuesday, I thought I'd share some thoughts on the huge influx of todo list apps on the iPhone  platform (and mobile in general). Already, Any.DO has garnered over [100,000 downloads in 24 hours](http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/05/any-dos-to-do-list-app-hits-100000-ios-downloads-in-24-hours/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29&utm_content=Google+Reader), but it's far from the first todo list app to gain such attention. Earlier this year, [Clear](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/), from [Real Mac Software](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/company/) made a [big splash](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/14/clear-why-this-simple-to-do-list-app-has-everyone-talking/) on sites like TechCrunch and the [New York Times](http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/to-do-check-out-clear/) before it even launched, quickly shot to #1 in the iPhone app stores all over the world, and dominated tech news (and conversation) for weeks. More recently, [Habit List](http://habitlistapp.com/) shot to the top of [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator) and was proclaimed by one of my friends "the most useful thingâ€”ever".

# I'll start with a personal story.

In case you couldn't tell, I like tech: I carry (and use) my iPhone constantly, sit in front of a computer for 10+ hours a day, and am constantly trying to "get more done." As such, I always thought that I could benefit from a todo list on my iPhone. I started off with Notes...and failed. With iOS 5, I started using Reminders (GPS! Push Notifactions! Yeah!)...and failed. Then came Clear (it's so b-e-a-utiful, it *must* work), which I seriously used...for under 2 weeks.

Unfortunately, I don't think I'm the only person who has suffered from this painful experience: for some reason, many people are unable to use todo list apps, yet constantly try and try again to make it work. So the question becomes, if it never ever works, why do we keep trying?

# Life is a ticking clock.

Our death is inevitable, every second counts, and each of us is constantly trying to squeeze as much as possible into the little time we have. Unfortunately, it can be *really hard* to get everything done (work, play, friends, family, vacation, love, to name a few). So, as humans do best, we look for an easy way out: that's where todo list apps come in.

# Todo list apps are a mind trick (and a very profitable one at that).

For people like me (evidently there are millions of us), the thought becomes "oh, obviously the easiest way to get things done is to get an app." Duh, right? We can download the app, fill out the little forms, have pretty little lists, and check off boxes for a week or two. Our consciouses are sated, we feel accomplished, and the todo list apps get downloaded millions of times. Three weeks later, however, it's a different story. The todo list app hasn't been opened in days, we move it to the second screen, and our lives haven't been revolutionized; still, that temporary relief is all we need to forget our worries and become carefree until The Next Big Thing (todo list app style) comes along. There are tons of stories on how many times todo list apps get downloaded, where are the logical next stories: the reasearch studies that prove downloading a todo list app improves your productivity ten fold. Here's a hint: they don't exist (and never will).

# Life is never as easy as downloading an app.
 
If you really want to get things done, [it takes a whole lot more effort](http://jessepollak.me/2012/05/28/day-8-a-meta-look-at-the-blog/).
