*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at Pomona College outside of Los Angeles. This summer, I'm a hackNY Fellow and technical intern at BuzzFeed. I'm living in Union Square, working in the Flatiron District, gradually finding my way around NYC, and hoping to learn as much as possible (about anything and everything). To assist in that learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day (I've never been able to last longer than a week, so wish me luck): today is day 11.*

Yeah, the title has no real meaning, just going to get that out of the way. I was trying to think up a good title and couldn't, so I chose the first thing to come to mind: Friday Freeeeday. As it is a Friday at 9:00, and I'm trying to get out of the apartment before 9:30, this post will be short.
 
The day was straightforward: gym at 8am, work at 9:30, home at 7:45pm, dinner at a slider place at 8pm, adventures in the city now.

The  **one big thing learned today** (if you're confused what that means, [see my first post](http://jpollak92.github.com/2012/05/21/day-1-dont-be-afraid-to-ask-questions/)) was Perl. By the end of today, I really started to feel like I had a real grasp on how the language works. By no means do I know it well, but everything is starting to make sense. Secondarily, I started getting more comfortable with d3.js since I was using it to graph some of the data I was using Perl to get. Here's a screenshot of the first prototype of the visualization I'm working on:

![Visualization](http://cl.ly/3J0x0J3f2L2g291I3H0K/Screen%20shot%202012-06-01%20at%206.46.42%20PM.png)

Basically, the lines are "clustered topics" and their 'popularity score' (y-axis) that are trending over time (x-axis). As you can see, the topics' popularity grow, fade, and disappear from the chart over time--pretty cool.

The one **new thing I want to learn and/or accomplish in the next few days (and for the rest of the summer)** is to get to know the other BuzzFeed interns better. I don't know any of them, but I had some contact with a couple of them today and they seem great. Maybe I'll reach out and try to organize a lunch or something. Next week!

Here are some **new and little learnings, tricks and tips**:

* interpolation in Perl is the bomb...no special characters involved!
* `$#array` to get the length of an array in Perl

And some *fun things*:

* Every day I walk past the same dump truck...it never gets more tolerable.
* Revolving doors were invented for two primary reasons: (1) soundproofing the lobbies of buildings and (2) airproofing the lobbies of building, so they don't waste heating/cooling
* If you're looking for awesome things to do in NYC, sign up for [Nonsense NYC](http://www.nonsensenyc.com/). It's a pretty awesome newsletter that spreads cool (and not mainstream) events. Check it out!

As promised, this was a short post, but it's a post nonetheless. I'll report back tomorrow on all of my (hopefully awesome) adventures tonight.
