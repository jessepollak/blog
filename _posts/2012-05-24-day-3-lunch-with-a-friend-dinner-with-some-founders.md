*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at Pomona College outside of Los Angeles. This summer, I'm a hackNY Fellow and technical intern at BuzzFeed. I'm living in Union Square, working in the Flatiron District, gradually finding my way around NYC, and hoping to learn as much as possible (about anything and everything). To assist in that learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day (I've never been able to last longer than a week, so wish me luck): today is day 2.*

Today was the first day I actually woke up feeling good; though, that may have been because I watched my roommate get up at 6:30am. Work was standard, I had lunch with Rishi Sangani from Pomona, and enjoyed dinner and a talk with the Codecademy founders Zach and Ryan. They gave an unbelievable talk and shared some really great wisdom—definitely great meeting them.

My **one big thing learned** (if you're confused what that means, [see my first post](http://jpollak92.github.com/2012/05/21/day-1-dont-be-afraid-to-ask-questions/) was that **reading and watching can only do so much**. Over the last few months, I feel like I've gradually complacent when it comes to learning. It is so easy to think that reading and 'learning' from the people on sites like Hacker News will help you advance both professionally and personally, but over the last couple of days I've come to realize that isn't the case. Coding (or **doing** anything) for 9 hours a day is what really helps you learn. In three days, I've gained more knowledge about Javascript, Node, Unix, and bash then I'd learned in the last 6 months—it feels amazing. Moral of the story: get off Hacker News and start doing.

Here are my **new and little learnings, tricks and tips** (if you haven't picked up on the trend, see my first post again):

* To do refreshes with changing time periods, use setTimeout, recursion, and clearTimeoout rather than setInterval
* .find() goes unlimited deep in the DOM, whereas .children() only goes one level
* XML is a terrible terrible thing, why doesn't everyone use JSON
* YC answers are advised to be 120 words, but should really be 60 (clarity)
* Object.prototype.function = function() {} can be used to add functions to an already existing class

Second to last, the  **new thing I want to learn and/or accomplish in the next few days** is commit to one direction when I get in the awkward dance while walking on the sidewalk.

And finally, **some fun things**:

* You can't tweet 'Get Better.' on Twitter
* Got my first recruiting email from a startup called Wildfire (wow)
* Standing desk time: 3/8 hours
* Goldman Sachs interviewers interview students to see if they are 'good enough to be as miserable as they were'

And finally, another view:
