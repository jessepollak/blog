*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 21. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me)*

It's officially been 3 weeks since I relocated to NYC and started my time with [hackNY](http://hackny.org) and [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). It's very possible that in the last 3 weeks, I've spent more hours coding (and doing things related to development) than I have in my entire life. And, if you've been reading this blog, you probably know that I've learned a whole lot; if you haven't, just trust that I have.

Over the last couple of days, I've started work on something new: a fairly small, outside of work, project that involves technologies I'm very familiar with (Ruby, Rails, MongoDB, Heroku, etc). Before I wrote the first line of code for it, I was confident that it would be an easy task: almost certainly taking no more than 6 hours. This has not been the case: as I've dug into the code, I've hit problems that take me hours to solve, stemming from concepts that I think should be easy. As you can probably guess, this tribulation has left me second guessing my abilities.
 
I've always had a lot of self doubt about my *h@ckz0r skillz*. I started significantly later than most of my peers (1.5 years ago), so from the start I've been playing catchup. Still, I'll say it, I feel like I've achieved a lot: I've created multiple web apps with hundreds of users, aced my computer science classes, built some cool hacks, and, more recently, been accepted to hackNY and achieved a lot in my first 3 weeks at BuzzFeed (maybe more than they were expecting from me). For some reason, however, these achievements feel false; almost as if I haven't *really* earned them, or that I've somehow just scrapped together my successes from the successes of other people (using OSS, reading Stack Overflow, following blog posts and tutorials).

I constantly feel like I don't *really* understand how things work; like things have been too abstracted away to let me really learn; like I'm learning how someone else did something, rather than the fundamental concepts that would let me solve the problem myself.

So, my question becomes, when do I hit the point where this self doubt stops? Or, does it never stop? It is easy to think that it could never stop: in its current state, software development and computer science is such a fast moving field that there are constantly new technologies, trends, and ideas to keep up with. Could it be possible that everyone feels the same way; constantly trying to keep up, always second guessing their abilities compared to others?

I doubt it. And, I'm hoping that in the next 2 months I'll overcome these qualms and really become a *true hacker*. Someone who really can solve problems quickly, efficiently, and beautifully.
