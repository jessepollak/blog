*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 26. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

Tomorrow is my first hackathon of the summer: [Hack n' Jill](http://hacknjill.com), a hackathon supporting women in the tech world that is comprised of 50 men and 50 women. I'm working with two other hackNY fellows (and maybe a dark horse) on an idea I've been percolating for awhile. Before I get to my idea, I thought I'd share some of the other ideas I heard tonight at the pre-hackathon mixer/team making session.

* A visualization of your Facebook friend's political donations and/or leanings. Do some data mining on Facebook likes/political leanings then cross reference user names with political contribution databases. With this data, you can hopefully create a cool chart of how liberal/conservative your friends are and who the biggest contributors to political campaigns are.

* An app that helps you connect with other people at the beach, then share contact information when you leave.

* A whimsical dating site that revolves around daily deals. The basic premise is that you put a ton of daily deals on a site; then, if a guy and girl choose the same deal they get put into a chat together. Eventually, the girl is given the option of giving the guy her number and they are connected (with the thought being that the guy would buy the girl the daily deal). I liked this idea.

* A real time visualization of the ages of people in different places using the Foursquare API. I loved this idea, however, the Foursquare API doesn't actually expose the information to make this possible, so it's pretty much impossible.

* A combination between Mint and Foursquare...although, I don't really know what that means.

* An app that lets you compete with friends to see who can wake up on time for the most consecutive days. 

* A data visualization that placed videos of olympians in an animated fluid made of tiny balls that then reacted to their movements in the video. Didn't really understand this one either.

On to my idea! So, this idea has actually been brewing in mind for awhile. Here's the pain point I'm trying to solve: as an intern moving to a new city, it can be really lonely, especially if you're under 21. You know no one, often live by yourself, and can feel isolated from people and helpless when trying to make new friends. Originally, my idea was to create a Grubwithus clone that focused purely on interns: basically, an intern would pay $15 and then they would just go to a dinner with 15 other interns. I would definitely do that. Unfortunately, an idea like that isn't a great candidate for a hackathon because most of the work is non-technical (working with restraunts, marketing etc). So, my team has decided to attack the same problem, but with a different idea. 

The basic premise of the app is simple. You log in using Facebook, and are prompted to enter the city you've lived in longest. Next, you look through your Facebook friends and mark 3 people that live in the same city who you think other friends of yours might like to meet. Then, you put in the city you're going to live in and the app spits out all of the friends of people who marked that city as their longest-lived-in-city. Basically, it's providing a network of people with 1 degree of separation to you in any given city. Obviously, the idea suffers from the classic chicken or egg problem (you need the network before it actually becomes useful), but I still think it's interesting. I also think it could be incentivized a little: maybe making it so the person who is going to the new city pays $5 for the connection, $2 of which goes to their friend and $2 of which goes to the 1 degree connection (with 1 free credit at the beginning). I don't really know, we'll see what happens!

As of now, my plan is to liveblog as we hack tomorrow, so if you're interested, follow along! I'll also be tweeting a lot at [@jessepollak](http://twitter.com/jessepollak), so feel free to check that out too!

Wish me luck!
