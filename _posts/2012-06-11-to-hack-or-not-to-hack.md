*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 22. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me)*

# A couple of days ago, I received an email from a student in the Stanford MBA program. 

Since I'm an "influential current college student in college on the west coast" (bah, i.e. I have a small web presence), he thought I might be able to share my thoughts on his startup idea. Since he reached out in confidence, I won't actually share his idea (although it is a good one); rather, I want to examine a dichotomy that appeared as we continued our conversation.

I always love talking to startup people, so I quickly wrote back to him asking if he would clarify his questions\*. We got to talking, I asked if I could see the product and I got to learn a little more about the startup and the people behind it. Both of them are Stanford MBAs and they are "still in early stages right now, working to prove out the market, channel customer demand, and clearly define the product." In addition, they "hope to lock down product plans soon and then cycle through funding options. Initial conversations are already underway on that front, but raising with more built commands a stronger seed valuation." 

# Wow, they are doing way more research on a product than I'd ever think of doing.

Then it hit me: these guys are taking a *completely* different startup path than I ever have, and probably ever will. 

# Here's my current process: 

Think up an idea, try to hack it together as quickly as possible, test it out in the open, gauge its success, then decide whether to continue; only then thinking about funding, legalities, and customer acquisition (although I've never actually gotten to that point..yet). 

# Here's what I assume theirs has been:

Think up an idea, decide to start a company, incorporate, reach out to potential customers, reach out to investors, "prove the market," "channel customer demand," then build a product and work to make it succeed.

I can't really comprehend how I'd go about it their way, and I doubt they can understand my process. And so the question becomes\*\*, which is the better way to "startup?"

# I think that there are pros and cons to both. 

With the hacking approach, you quickly have a product to show users, so you can iterate if people are interested and quit if they aren't. However, this often leads to wasting a lot of time building things that people don't want. With the planning approach, you establish interest before you build the product, so that problem is solved. However, it's a lot harder to test an idea without a product; and, if you take too much time testing a bad market, you can often waste just as much time as building a bad product.

#I don't think I'll ever ditch the hacking approach.

Wandering into the darkness that is the startup world with just an idea seems a little too dangerous: I need something solid that I've created to support my beliefs and confidence. And, while I say that, I still think I have a ton to learn from the other approach. I've mentioned it here before, but I think I need to better understand the *full* picture, rather than just the coding. Hopefully I can learn to take the best from both sides.

# **What path do you take? Do you think the binary dichotomy in "starting up" exists?**




\*Lesson learned: always ask straightforward and clear questions when reaching out to random people for advice and/or feedback. I wasn't going to think about his open ended question, and if I wasn't really interested, I would have just deleted the email rather than email back for clarifications.
