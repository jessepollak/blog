This morning, I woke up to "Is Mark Zuckerberg in over his hoodie as Facebook CEO?," a painful piece of writing and thought put out by the LA Times. The basic premise is that because Facebook's share price has dropped so rapidly, Mark Zuckerburg should really consider "step[ing] aside as CEO to let a more seasoned executive run the multibillion-dollar company." With prime quotes from investors such as:

"There is a growing sense that Mark Zuckerberg, talented though he may be, is in over his hoodie as CEO of a multibillion-dollar public company."

and

"Every investor thought they were about to become wealthy beyond their wildest dreams, and they had this blow up in their face"

it's clear that the people interviewed in the article think: Zuckerburg should have priced the IPO at $20 a share; essentially giving away half of the company, so investors would be "pleased." 

The way I see it, and I'm sure most in the tech world do as well, Zuckerburg and Facebook did extremely well by [raising $16 billion in the IPO](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/05/17/facebook-raises-16-billion-in-i-p-o/?pagewanted=all). And, while this may have "hurt" the early public investors who may have had the *unreasonable* expectation that they would "become wealthy beyond their wildest dreams," you can't exactly call it a calamity for the company. Putting that much money in the bank can only lead to good things in the future.

# So, what should Zuckerburg do in response to all of this chatter?

Step down? Cede the CEOship? *Hell no.*

If I were him, I'd take the any money that he has left over from the [$1.1 billion he just cashed out at $37.58 a share](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57440266-93/zuckerberg-cashes-in-$1.1-billion-selling-facebook-stock/) (most of it was used for tax purposes) and **buy back as much Facebook stock as he can**. While the purchase will be a pittance compared to the rest of his hoarde, with shares at nearly half the price of what he sold at, it won't be nothing. Not only would he further strengthen his grip on the company, he'd also reinforce the notion that he believes Facebook will be an extremely successful company in the long term.


Zuckerburg isn't going anywhere and he should make that very well known. All this speculation and bullshit can only distract, he should put it to rest if he can.
