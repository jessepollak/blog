Yesterday, I attended a panel that examined whether the type of writing we learn to do in college, "academic writing," is a useful skill. There was no general consensus either way: the more anti-college speaker argued that writing for one reader (the professor) is unhelpful, that students should strive to set their own deadlines and topics, and that the best way to learn is to form a mutually beneficial relationship with real writers rather than being "taught" by someone. The professor among the group suggested that the deadlines and topics given by professors help to focus students' writing and that the guaranteed single reader (the professor) is better than no reader.

Ignoring the specifics on either side of the discussion, I took away one key point from the discussion: while some writing is better than no writing, deciding to take personal time to write in a non-academic setting is the best thing you can do to hone your talent. Ever since the discussion, I felt like I'd heard something along those lines before, but I couldn't place it. Then, as I sat down to do a little coding, I finally realized: it's what I've been preaching to my peers in the computer science program at Pomona.

As I thought about it further, the similarities between coding and writing in academic versus non-academic settings are remarkable. When I'm coding or writing for an academic class, the process is the same: the professor sets the topic, deadline, and structure; I write what's necessary, edit and test insufficiently (most of the time), and submit it right before the deadline. When I'm doing either outside of class, similarities emerge as well: I pick the topic, deadline, and structure; I write more than what's necessary (and enjoy it); and, while I still may test insufficiently, I'll never "finish" something until I'm proud of how well it works.

I can't attest to the writing side of things, but the personal coding I do has proved to be exponentially more valuable than the coding I do in class. It has helped me learn new technologies, taught me how to work in a team, and led to the job I just got for the summer. On the other hand, the coding I've done for class thus far has taught me nothing. Now, this may just be because I'm in just finishing up the intro CS track, but I'm confident that I could teach myself everything in the more advanced classes...if I had the motivation.

Motivation. That's where I think the flaw in arguing that academic writing and coding is useless comes in. Yes, in an ideal world, every student would have the motivation to write and code outside of class, teach themselves anything that they want to learn, and put themselves on the path to achieve great things. Unfortunately, we don't live in an ideal world, only a very limited number of students can achieve those feats, and the rest need a little more structure and discipline (think college) to achieve their goals. Is that problem? Yes. Do I think it is going to go away? Absolutely not.

From personal experience, I can attest to the fact that it is really hard to motivate yourself to do things outside of class. Do you see any other posts on this blog? Nope. But, I don't think that means we shouldn't try. That's all I do and, surprisingly, "just trying" has helped me learn a whole lot.

So, back to the academic discussion: I think writing and coding for class are better than nothing, but I also do not believe that they are going to help you achieve anything great. If you want to become great at something, you have to want it. And, when you want something, you'll have the motivation to dedicate your personal time to it.
