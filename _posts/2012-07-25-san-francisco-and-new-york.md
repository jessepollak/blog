*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 64. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

One of the largest topics of conversation in the NYC tech scene is very meta: how is the tech scene in the City compared to Silicon Valley; how will it grow in the next 10 years; what do we need to do to make it even more amazing. In fact, just a couple weeks ago, I wrote a [brief post comparing my gut reactions to the two](http://jessepollak.me/2012/07/15/some-differences-between-nyc-and-sv/).

Tonight, [hackNY](http://hackny.org) was lucky enough to have [the partners](http://www.usv.com/team/) at [Union Square Ventures](http://www.usv.com/) as our final speaking guests. We discussed a range of topics ranging from building a social networking protocol to analyzing market conditions, but a brief touch on the above topic really stuck with me.

As the last question of the night, I asked "how they thought the Silicon Valley and NYC tech scenes would transform over the next 5 years." The answer, primarily provided by [Brad Burnham](http://content.usv.com/pages/brad-burnham) caught me a little off guard. In the past, when thinking about the juxtaposition of the Valley and NYC, I always grouped San Francisco in with SV. Brad, however, made a clear distinction. Rather than couple the west coast locations, he suggested that he thought the actual Silicon Valley was going to decline, but SF and NYC we're going to grow.

Why? Because the "innovation that fueled the growth of Silicon Valley was largely about connecting computer to computers; however, with the internet infrastructure mostly built, the ongoing and future innovation would largely be built on connecting people to people." And, to connect people to people, you need to be in a place with people; with culture; with diversity; so you can understand the dynamics that power communities. That's why vigorous cities like NYC and SF will thrive, while sleepy tech centers like Palo Alto may suffer.

I think he's right.
