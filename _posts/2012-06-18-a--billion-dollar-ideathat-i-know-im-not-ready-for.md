*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 29. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

# Over the last few days, I've been thinking about what I believe is a $1 billion, or maybe even $100 billon, idea. 

It all began on a long metro ride with someone I'd never met before. Talk turned to startups and he mentioned he had an idea that he thought was cool: a location based search for products, rather than stores. Basically, the ability to whip out your iPhone, type in umbrella, and have all the stores with umbrellas pop up around you. Now, this is a great idea, but the implementation is where I think it really starts to turn from good to great.

Right now, the vast majority of brick and mortar stores use some sort of archaic inventory system—if any at all. Yes, some big stores like Walmart and Best Buy are developing better solutions, but these companies are a small minority. 

# Here's the idea: create a beautiful, easy to use, inventory application for brick and mortar stores: then give it to them for free. 

Yes, free. As in they pay you nothing. Here's what you do get: access to all of their information on products and inventory. Basically, you trade an amazing service, for a huge amount of data. A barter deal at its finest.

Now, consider for a second what you could do with that data. First, you could create the previously mentioned product search, then monetize the crap out of it: let the same stores pay you in a different way; by giving you money to boost the frequency they come up in searches. Next, you could open up the information in an easy to use API—something, which other developers and companies (like Google + Yelp) would pay you lots of money to use. And that's only the beginning. I honestly believe that, if done correctly, this idea could literally be The Next Big Thing®.

Here's the catch.

# This is a ten year idea.

First, the development of the software would almost certainly take tens, if not hundreds, of labor years by skilled programmers. Next, you'd have to build relationships with companies, big and small, to let you get your product in their stores. And, only then, could you finally start doing the cool stuff.

I've been thinking a lot about this, and I've come to realize something.

# I'm not ready for an idea this big.

It's actually something that's very hard to admit. I've always thought that I could commit to something huge, at any time, at any age. What I've come to realize, however, is that I still have so much to learn and so many things to do before I really feel comfortable committing the next 10 years to any one thing.

Luckily, I've also come to realize something else.

# That's OK.

Maybe, right now I'm not ready, but give me a few months and who knows what will happen. In the meantime, I'll be learning as much as possible, as quickly as possible, in as many ways and places as possible, from as many people as possible.
