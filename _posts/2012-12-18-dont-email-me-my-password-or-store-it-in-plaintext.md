Of late, I've gotten pretty into chess. I never played much as a kid, but a couple months ago my friends started playing and I joined in. I'm not very good (even for a beginner), so I've decided to read and practice to get a little better.

At the suggestion of a friend, I decided to join the [Internet Chess Club](http://chessclub.com), so I could play some games online and hone my skills. I went to the site, registered, verified my email, and got the following email in my inbox:

Yes, they sent me an email with my password in plaintext (I \*\*\*\*\*'d it out)--what the fuck. Not only that, but the fact that they can send me my password in plaintext means that they are *storing* it in plaintext.

Obviously, you don't need the highest level of security for your chess account, but in this modern day and age it is unacceptable to store passwords (and email them) in plaintext. Not only can that chess account be used to make purchases and access confidential information like your billing address, but if a hacker cracks their server, they have a huge set of plaintext passwords corresponding to user's emails--most people use only 1 or 2 passwords for all of their accounts, so this is a pretty big deal.

I promptly changed my password and deleted my account. You should too if you're a member of the ICC.

Oh, and if you hate passwords as much as I do, you should check out [Clef](https://clef.io), the startup I'm working on that is getting rid of usernames and passwords and replacing them with your mobile phone.
