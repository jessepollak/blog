*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 53. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

In case you didn't already know, mentor.im (my team at AngelHack) didn't end up winning the national prize. [Appetas](http://www.appetas.com/), an easy website maker for websites, and [GiveGo](http://www.givego.co/) a mini-charity fundraiser with already huge traction won the $25,000 seed money. [ShareBrowse](http://www.sharebrowse.com/), a pretty awesome browser session sharing utility, created by a 15 year old, won a "special prize"—in other words, he's set for life. 

To be honest though, I'm not particularly disappointed by our loss. I think that our pitch was phenomenal, and as I said to the team, it really came down to whether the judges bought into our idea or not. In the end, they didn't—or at least not more than Appetas, GiveGo, and ShareBrowse. There was, however, some recompense: we got anonymous feedback from the judges and it was all overwhelmingly positive. Here are some choice snippets:
  
  

> "Great idea, and some real execution here."
> 
> "The concept reminds me of VYou but I think the private nature is a strong differentiator. The design is simple, elegant and implies credibility. If the National Mentoring Partnership could get behind this it would greatly increase your level of success. It's unclear how you might monetize this. Presumably the mentees could pay a fee and the mentors would do it out of good will."
> 
> "Love the idea, website looks semi functional as well. Obviously there are privacy/creeper concerns however"
> 
> "good work"
> 
> "Now this is the type of social impact tool I'm talking about!"
> 
> "Love this idea. As a founder of a company that is built on mentorship, this is a great platform." 
> 
> "Absolutely brilliant. Beautiful, welcoming UI, awesome/simple navigation, and seamless access through FB login. Taking mentorship to new heights and removing geographic barriers is key to mentoring and empowering more young people to stay focused in pursuit of their goals. The video only and message interaction is great for security on both ends. Strong reminder to Quora and Formspring but the video adds an awesome dimension."
> 
> "Great idea and nice implementation. Good luck!"
> 
> "Really nice idea and much needed."
> 
> "I would look into what partnerships you can do with organizations in the areas that you mentioned to get this started with users. Also, I think the tech platform is cool that could be applied to multiple different things as well. Overall, very interesting idea."
> 
> "Seems like a well baked product, interesting concept"
> 
> "Very cool idea. The team needs to make sure the platform is super robust. Reputation of the service is huge."
> 
> "I love the concept and think it has huge potential value to the users."
> 
> "Good idea and nice design."

  
While we didn't win, it feels good to know we made something that industry experts actually thought was awesome. I have to believe that counts for something.

I said this to a friend yesterday, but I'll say it here too. With each attempt, I learn more; know more. With each attempt, I feel myself, and the teams I work with, doing better; getting further. This was #2. #3 is coming up. Stay tuned.
