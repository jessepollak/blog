*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 26. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

As I mentioned yesterday, I'll be liveblogging the hackathon I'm participating in today, [Hack 'n Jill](http://hacknjill.com). Here we go!

**8:08am**: Woke up 10 minutes later than usual and greeted my roommate with a war cry of "You're going down!!!" Neither of us really care about winning though.
