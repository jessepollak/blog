*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 54. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

At Pomona, if I'm sitting in a coffee shop, I will rarely hear a discussion about tech. If I do, my ears instantly perk up and I almost always inject myself into the conversation.

In NYC, if I'm sitting in a coffee shop, there's a good chance one or two groups of people will be talking tech. But, as [Chris Dixon](http://cdixon.org/) said when he talked to [hackNY](http://hackny.org) a couple weeks ago, you can comfortably have a "confidential" conversation in public without worrying about someone stealing your idea or exposing your company secrets. 

On Friday, I walked into a coffee shop in San Francisco and it was unlike anything I'd ever experienced. Within 5 seconds, I heard "users," "conversions," "mongoDB," and "ruby." With one quick glance, I saw 5+ people writing code. After 5 minutes, I could confidently say that 25+ of the 30 people in the shop were talking about, or working on, startups.

Last week, I traveled to Silicon Valley to compete in the [AngelHack](http://angelhack.com) finals with [Mentor.im](http://mentor.im). We didn't win (unfortunately), but it was still an amazing experience: I met some cool people, got a few "firsts" out of the way, and, most importantly, learned a whole lot. One of the most interesting things about the trip was experiencing first hand the stark contrast between the startup scene in New York and the one in Silicon Valley.

Being a part of [hackNY](http://hackny.org), I've become rather attached to the New York tech scene. Compared to the behemoth that is SV, the community here feels like the underdog. We don't have Stanford; Apple, Google and Facebook weren't founded here; and, while tech is definitely the hot "thing," the environment is nowhere near as saturated. For the entire summer, and especially in the weeks leading up to the trip, I was constantly told about this contrast, but until I actually hopped across the country, I didn't really "get it."

As I mentioned above, the biggest difference is pure saturation. In Silicon Valley, you are constantly surrounded by likeminded people. This can have a both positive and negative effects. 

On one hand, your brain is constantly pushed into thinking about technology and startups. Plus, the people you're interacting with are for the most part extremely intelligent human beings with whom conversing with is a pleasure. This means thought processes happen 10x (arbitrary multiplier) faster. Whereas if you have an idea in NYC, you might have to hunt down some people to bounce it off of. In SV, it practically feels like you can turn to the person next to you and have your concept validated (or destroyed) within a few seconds. 

On the other hand, this hyper-saturated environment definitely creates a feedback loop (and bubble), which can be dangerous. When all you think about is tech, and the only way you think about it is through the small lens of startups (and mostly consumer startups), it's easy to think "inside the box." In NYC, I feel like there are more people interested in different things: this allows conversations that wouldn't happen in SV; stimulating different thoughts and ideas. 

Furthermore, this positive reinforcement of the same ideas can create an environment where people always think the same way—and think that way is the right way. Whether it was advice, ideas, or criticisms, I felt like I kept on hearing the same things coming from the mouths of different, albeit all very "important" and well-respected, people. And, it felt like the people telling me these things *knew* that they were giving The Right Advice®.

In NYC, I've been given the chance to hear from a lot of "important" people as well and they all lead or close with more or less the same line: 

*"I'm not always right, but I have learned a lot from my mistakes. This is just advice; this has worked for me, but may not work for you."*

I loved Silicon Valley, and I'm sure I'll be back there soon, but NYC feels a little more like home.
