Over the last 2 days, I've made it a mission to unsubscribe from every email I'm not interested in. Anytime an email shoots into my inbox that I don't immediately want to open, I quickly open it and click the unsubscribe link. For the most part, companies are reasonably respectful in the way the handle this process: most require no extra work and display a page saying I've been unsubscribe, some have required me to reenter my email address, and a few have forced my to sign in and 'manage my preferences.'

Those steps, while sometimes annoying, are pretty reasonable. In fact, I usually leave the interaction feeling pretty good about the company I'm unsubscribing from (especially if they make it really easy); they understand that if I wanted the emails, I wouldn't be unsubscribing. There is, however, one thing that a select few companies do that bothers me to no end: **after I unsubscribe, I get an email 5 minutes later telling me that I've unsubscribed.**

I get that you don't want people unsubscribing by accident, but please don't do this. It may be petty, but for some reason the companies that do this are the only ones who I leave with a worse opinion of.
