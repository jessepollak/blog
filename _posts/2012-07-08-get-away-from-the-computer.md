*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 48. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

At least for a little while.

The last two weeks, I can honestly say that I've been in front of a computer for more time than any other two weeks in my life. Between BuzzFeed and [Mentor.im](http://mentor.im), I code a solid 10-12 hours a day, 6 days a week. Then, in the time I do have to relax, I've been too tired to leave my apartment, so I often just read the news or watch TV—on my computer (shocker). Combined, it means I spend anywhere from 12-16 hours a day in front of a screen; 70-90% of my waking hours.

This weekend, with friends from out of town in the city, I've been "forced" to step away from the screen and experience the real world a little more than usual. Friday, I wrote code 'till 11pm, but went out 'till 5am. Saturday, I went on a 4 mile walk, ate some awesome food, got soaked in the rain, and went to bed with my legs hurting and my happiness quotient filled. Today, I've been at a computer since 1pm, but felt refreshed for most of the day.

The importance of leaving the computer really struck me as I was walking home tonight. For the last hour of work, I'd been struggling with a really simple problem: how to create an upwardly bound function to solve a specific issue. It sounds stupid, but after staring at a computer all day, my brain felt completely frazzled; the solution was practically on the tip of my tongue, but I couldn't get it out.

On the way home, I, once again, made a bad decision with the train and ended up having to take a 20 minute walk home. About halfway through, the solution to the easy problem I'd been struggling with clicked in my head ( f(x) = 1 - .5/x, duh ). Then, a minute later, I realized a solution to a harder problem I'd been having. As I walked into my apartment lobby, another puzzle seemingly pieced itself together.

Over the last few weeks, with so many concrete goals and deadlines on the horizon, I've adopted the attitude that the more time I invest in a specific activity, the more production I'll achieve. It's an easy trap to fall into: sitting in front of a computer, it's easy it *feel* like you're getting work done, even if you're mind is too tired to actually solve problems. Today, it's finally clicked in my head that time isn't proportional to productivity. Yes, you need to work hard and long, but I also think it's a good idea to break up that work with other—completely different—activities. Like seeing friends; or eating good food; or taking a long walk.

When I switch up the activity, I switch the way my brain is processing information and solving problems. Therefore, I may just be able to find a different solution to a problem I'd been having earlier.

I can't say I've been particularly good at taking breaks this summer, but for the next few weeks I'm going to try and do better. I'll work, and get the things that I need to do done, but I'll also try to step outside, take a run (or a walk), and do things away from a screen.

If you're reading this (and got this far), you're probably a lot like me. Maybe you should do the same. 

If you're in NYC, you should call me (or email me) and we can take a break together.
