*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 46. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

Well, to say the least, it has been a hectic day. Yesterday, I realized I made a big mistake and [wrote a blog post about it](http://jessepollak.me/2012/07/05/dont-fing-trim-the-copy/). Today, I realized that writing that blog post [was another mistake](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4206147). It was a [rough wakeup](http://jessepollak.me/2012/07/05/dont-fing-trim-the-copy/#comment-577832234) to the real world after enjoying a wonderful 4th of July in Woodstock. And, unsurprisingly given the current startup culture, many people were quick to jump on me for [even](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4206658) [taking](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4206837) [a vacation](http://jessepollak.me/2012/07/05/dont-fing-trim-the-copy/#comment-577980948) [at all](http://jessepollak.me/2012/07/05/dont-fing-trim-the-copy/#comment-577989946). Accordingly, I thought I'd share some photos from the trip.

I work hard and get things done. I inform my coworkers of my limitations and plan around them. I'm a kid. It's the summer. Leave the living up to me.
