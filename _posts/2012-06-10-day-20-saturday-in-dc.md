*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 18. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me)*

Earlier than last night, but still not early. It's late Saturday (technically Sunday) and I'm checking in. Today was my first day back in DC in three weeks and it lived up to all of my expectations. Between family and friends, I had my fair share of fun. Here are some of the pictures of the day:

Having a evening in DC after three weeks in NYC really gives me perspective on how different the two places are. DC really is like a suburb...we drive from place to place, the neighborhoods are residential, and there just aren't that many people. NYC is chaos—anywhere and everywhere—and it's awesome. Both cities are special, and I love them equally.
