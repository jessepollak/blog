*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at Pomona College outside of Los Angeles. This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). I'm living in Union Square, working in the Flatiron District, gradually finding my way around NYC, and hoping to learn as much as possible (about anything and everything). To assist in that learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day (I've never been able to last longer than a week, so wish me luck): today is day 8.*

A week and a day ago when I set out to blog every day for the entire summer, I honestly didn't know how long I would last. In the past, I'd never made it past a couple days and in my lifetime, I've probably written less than 20 blog posts total. So, setting out to write for 70 straight days was (and is) a daunting task. A week in, I have some reflections on what has enabled me to make it this far and what have been (and will be) some of the largest challenges.

# It's impossible for me to remember everything, so I don't.

Instead, I let a notebook do it all for me. A week ago, I decided to make a lifestyle change: rather than passively trying to remember everything that happened to me during the day, I would actively record my daily thoughts and encounters. I went to Walgreens, bought a pocket notebook and pack of pens, and committed to carrying them at all times. With a physical reminder constantly weighing down my pockets, I always remember to write down the interesting things I see, do, and hear. In the past when I wanted to write, I would struggle to remember the things I did each day; now, I can flip through the pages and see my thoughts in chronological order. My notebook let's me remember quotes I loved from a speaker, startup ideas I have during the day, that delicious food truck I ate at for lunch, and everything in between. As an additional plus, whipping out a notebook and pen during any conversation seems to lend a certain level of credibility; perhaps it shows that I really care, and am interested in, what the other person is talking about.

# I set a schedule.

On weekdays, I've committed to writing right before I get into bed (even if I stay on my computer after I'm in bed). On weekends, I've committed to writing *before* I start getting ready to go out (and recapping the night in the next day's post). Without a schedule, I would be way more likely to "put if off to the next day": the kiss of death for any daily activity.

# I settled on a structure for my posts.

In the past, I've struggled to decide on a structure for each post I write. This initial road block would often be too much to overcome, so this summer I decided to settle on a structure for every post I write. In each weekday post, I discuss **one big thing** and **a few small things** I learn each day, **one or two things I want to learn or achieve** in the coming days, and **some fun things that happened during the day**. On weekends, I take a break from technology and focus on the places I go and things I do in New York City (with lots of pictures included). Then, whenever I want, I feel free to diverge from the schedule for a more reflective post, like this one! With a structure in place, I find it much easier to "fill in the blanks" with my thoughts and activities from the day and get into a rhythm with my writing.

# I can't burn out.

After coding at BuzzFeed for ~9 hours, coding at home with the hackNY fellows for a few hours, and being on a computer all day, it can often be hard to make that *final push* to write a post. A few days this week, that final push was really hardâ€”and this was only week one. I love my job, love coding with the fellows, and love my computer, but I need to mix enough other things in to my daily routines that I don't burn out.

# I can't put things off

If I tell myself that I'll write something down in my notebook later, I'll forget it. If I say that I'll write two posts tomorrow, I won't do either. I mentioned it earlier, but I need to remain disciplined if I want to reach my goals. Already this week, I've been tempted to put things off: I must avoid the temptation.
