*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 56. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

The literal answer is a bit confusing, but rather straightforward. According to a [knowledgeable poster on Quora](http://www.quora.com/Why-do-clothes-shrink-when-you-wash-them),

*"Cotton and nylon and other common textiles used in clothing are all polymers.  A polymer completely stretched into a linear arrangement has a much lower entropy than a polymer "wound up"....when the material is put in the dryer, the heat energy breaks many of the crosslinking bonds.  When it slowly cools, it winds up into a higher entropy state, associated with shorter chain lengths, and tighter clothes."*

Not entirely easy to grasp, but understandable with a little effort (go to the original post, linked above, if you don't quite get it).

It's not the literal answers that I'm after though. As I was folding my clothes this evening, and noticing that I once again shrunk some of my t-shirts, I began to wonder the psychological reasons behind why my clothes shrink. Let's lay out the basics:

- I know that if I put the wrong clothes in hot water, they will shrink
- I know that if I dry my clothes for too long, they will shrink

So, with this knowledge, why do my clothes shrink? As a rationale human being, it would be easy to posit that with this understanding, I should be able to predict possible outcomes and prevent bad ones. In fact, here are the logical steps I should take:

1. Examine my clothes and understand which fabrics are in which items
2. Take 5 minutes to go online and see which things can handle heat and which cannot
3. Act accordingly

Truthfully, such a process would probably take less than 30 minutes, and would probably save me a lot of time, money and energy in return. Unfortunately, it seems that in my situation that is not the case.

Analyzing the situation, a few key thoughts jump out at me about my laundry process:

- starting this morning, I was set on doing my laundry tonight
- today, I forgot that we had an event tonight
- I inappropriately mentally allocated my time for this evening

In other words, I didn't dedicate my entire energy and thought to doing my laundry. Instead, I juggled (1) a meeting (2) coding for a project and (3) brainstorming a blog piece; all while trying to do laundry. Accordingly, I botched the process, putting the wrong clothes in the wrong washers—and because my meeting went late—ended up leaving the clothes in the dryer for what I knew was too long.

It's easy to think that a task like doing the laundry is so simple it can be shoved to the back of your brain. My constant struggles with shrunken clothes—and I'm sure some of you have had the same problems—seem to prove otherwise.

Maybe laundry is a lot more interesting than I thought.
