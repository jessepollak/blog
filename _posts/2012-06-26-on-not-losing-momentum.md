*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu). This summer, I'm a [hackNY](http://hackny.org) Fellow and technical intern at [BuzzFeed](http://buzzfeed.com). To assist in my learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day: today is day 37. You can [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/jessepollak) or keep reading my [blog](http://jessepollak.me).*

Yesterday, I reflected on the technical issue of choosing the right stack for hackathon success. Today, I'm going to go non-technical and examine how to handle the aftermath of a hackathon (or any huge event for that matter). If you didn't already know, the reason I'm writing these posts is that my team, [Mentor.im](http://mentor.im) recently placed in the top 6 of AngelHack NYC and is headed to SV to pitch to investors in two weeks. I learned a lot over the 36 hours of hacking—and am learning even more now—so I thought I'd share those lessons with the world.

During and directly after any big event, the adrenaline rush is absurd. It allows you to stay up all night, think clearly under extreme stress, suffer miserable conditions, and do things you once thought were impossible. Unfortunately, once you've slept off the thrill, this rush will fade and you're left with the regular you.

For an event like AngelHack, where the competition doesn't actually end for another 3 weeks, this can often be a disheartening feeling. Personally, I know that the rush during and right after the hackathon was absurd, but a day later I started considering what I was getting myself into. At this point, I'm on a team of 5, each of us juggling a full time job and building a startup from scratch. We are all tired. We are all busy. We are all working our asses off; but we can't have that constant adrenaline rush to keep us going. Accordingly, it can be very easy to lose momentum.

Tonight, we were supposed to meet at 10pm, but things got in the way. And, for the first time, I started to see how everything could fall apart very quickly. Once one meeting doesn't happen, the next one is way less likely to occur. Once one thing doesn't get finished, it can feel like an impossible barrier to overcome.

Luckily, the team pulled together and met—just a little later. We have also adopted (or I've tried to have a forced adoption) a policy of focusing on "actionable tasks." Each meeting, we try to set the next meeting *AND* each choose one or two things that we feel we can accomplish by then. That way, there is always a concrete task we can be working on, we have an easy way to track real progress, and, honestly, who doesn't like the feeling of checking off tasks.

For me, not losing momentum is all about consistency. Just like writing these blog posts every day, or working out every morning, for a startup to keep going I think you need to work on it every day. Otherwise, it can easily fade from your mind; get put off until 'later'; and be lost to the world of unfinished tasks.

My next actionable task is rewriting our main application functionality in Backbone.js...a scary (but appealing) task consider the first time I touched it was 5 hours ago. I've already made progress, so I'm hoping to get it done by Thursday (and write a blog post on the experience).

I just have to remember two words: keep doing.
