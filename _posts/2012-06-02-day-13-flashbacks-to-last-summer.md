*I'm Jesse Pollak, a rising sophomore at Pomona College outside of Los Angeles. This summer, I'm a hackNY Fellow and technical intern at BuzzFeed. I'm living in Union Square, working in the Flatiron District, gradually finding my way around NYC, and hoping to learn as much as possible (about anything and everything). To assist in that learning process, I've decided to write a blog post every day (I've never been able to last longer than a week, so wish me luck): today is day 13.*

Yep, I'm writing a blog post about my day...before it's even happened. Why, you may ask? Well, I'm about to head out to a day long birthday party for Kim Merrill from Pomona, followed by dinner and a night on the town. Thus, since there's no chance I'll be in any mood to write when I get home late tonight, now's the only time. As such, since I've only been awake for an hour or so today, I'll talk about last night. 

It was a pretty cool night: to start, I met up with my cousin, Belmont Pinger, and tromped to the west side for a small get together at a friend of his' house. Coincidentally enough, I actually knew this girl: I had met her in a night club in Berlin about this time last year. That same night, I met one of her friends, David, who's gone on to be one of my best friends at college. It's actually a pretty good story, so I'll take this blog post to tell it.

Picture this: my 4 best friends from home and I walking into a 7 story tall factory-turned-night-club called Tresor in the East Side of Berlin. As we greet the huge bouncers standing outside, we hear people speaking English behind us and turn to find a group of kids about our age...all from NYC. Being stupid teenagers, we introduced ourselves as juniors in college rather than rising freshmen (we didn't know how old *they* were!), so from the start there was a little confusion. However, I soon realized that one of the kids there—David—would be attending Pomona the following fall with me. Accordingly, I switched my story to the truth: that I was a rising freshmen too and wanted to get to know him. We ended up in a darkish corner of the club and David got a little freaked out because he didn't believe I was telling the truth. In fact, he thought I was a crazy German dude and asked me if I was 'trying to rape him.' Obviously I wasn't, so to prove it to him we bonded over the Pomona mascot, the Sagehens. The night was great, I'd met a kid going to Pomona, but my friends and I moved onto the next city (Vienna) and forgot about it.

Fast forward 2 months to move-in day at Pomona. I'm unpacking my stuff in my new room with my family and I see a familiar face walk by. I duck into the room next door and there David was, unpacking his stuff in the room directly next to mine. Long story short, we've gone on to be great friends and must have one of the best meeting stories ever.

Story over. After we had hung out at Claire's (the girl who I met that same night who's house Belmont and I went to last night) house for a while, the group of us got on the L train and went to Brooklyn for a show. As we left the metro, it started pouring, but none of us seemed to mind (at least on the way there). We made it to the venue, payed the steep cover charge, and settled into some pretty awesome music. The venue had a porch outside that had a tiny overhang above it, so we could stand outside even as it was pouring. Talking with my cousin as we watched the heavy rain—tinted pink by the glow coming from inside—fall onto the empty streets of Brooklyn was one of the best moments of the week. This was also in the bathroom:

Today, I'm headed uptown for lunch...and then I have no idea. The one thing I do know is that I want to do things, and try things, and go places, and see things, and meet people, and have fun. I'll report back on my adventures tomorrow.
